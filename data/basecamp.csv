If youre unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation youd like to talk about, ping Jason or David. Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. Thats too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates. Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to 37signals, etc). Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.

21|24|This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we cant easily improve what we havent articulated. So whatever version of this handbook youre reading, you can be sure its not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, were not just talking about misspellings and team changes. Its just as much we say were about X, but what were really doing is Y. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions.

With so many concurrent projects, things began to slip through the cracks. Projects dragged on too long. We dropped the ball on key deliverables. We had some major miscommunication.

82|77|Lo and behold, our projects ran better! We regained the sense of order and calmness wed been craving. And clients noticed they really appreciated the improved communication and organization. Soon after, our clients started asking us what software we were using to run these projects. Turns out they wanted to use it for their own in-house projects! So, we polished it up and put it on the market. On February 5th, 2004, Basecamp was born, and within a year, Basecamp was generating more income for us than our web design business, so we shuttered the web design firm to focus solely on Basecamp.

84|78|Fast forward to 2014. Wed been feeling pulled in too many directions for too long. Campfire, Highrise, Backpack, and a host of other products were taking away from what we really wanted to do: maintain and improve Basecamp. So we spun off, sold, or otherwise sunset our ancillary products, and dedicated the entire companys efforts to Basecamp.

85|80|HEY is our love letter to email. While our internal communications are almost exclusively in Basecamp (with code reviews in GitHub the primary exception), we still correspond with some external service providers and customers via email. Every time we needed to do that, we felt the drag: how much harder it was to manage and stay on top of email. So we eventually decided to do something about it.

86|81|In 2014, we decided to spin off or sell our other (very successful!) applications. One of those was Highrise, our customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Highrise became a subsidiary of 37signals run by its own board, executive, and staff. In 2018, we took back control of Highrise, disbanded the separate company, and turned off new signups. Highrise is now, as Basecamp Classic, Basecamp 2, Backpack, and Campfire, part of our until-the-end-of-the-internet legacy.

131|127|The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.|How are smaller things bundled together?|into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed|277|332
132|128|This is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about whats reasonable and whats not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.|How do you approach a budget slippage?|to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain|536|583

134|129|In between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. Thats the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. Its sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but its helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as pencils down. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.|What is the length of time between each cycle?|two weeks|32|41

185|167|Turn The Ship Around: Leadership should mean giving control rather than taking control and creating leaders rather than forging followers, David Marquet. 37signals employs great people and they deserve the freedom and autonomy to act on their own. Dont wait for permission, just state what youre going to do, and then do it. Finding Flow: True happiness is found in optimal moments of engagement when we stretch just beyond our abilities and lose track of time and space in the process. Protecting the flow by limiting interruptions has been a driving principle of 37signals. Punished by Rewards: We dont strive for trophies, swoon for trinkets, gameify our apps with badges, or push any other form of extrinsic motivation for neither ourselves nor our customers. Working at 37signals should be about the intrinsic motivation of doing a good job, not because youre trying to impress someone else. The Manual: Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things. Core lessons on keeping calm and carrying on that have inspired and guided us. Maverick: Ricardo Semler helped us find the confidence to promote and push for weird and different ways of working by showing just how weird and different you can work at even a place as stodgy as a 8,000-person industrial company in Brazil.|Who helped us find the confidence to promote and push for weird and different ways of working?|Ricardo Semler|1092|1106
186|168|What We Stand For Values Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everythings harder when we all believe different things about whats important to us, our company. Key values:|What comes first, values or something else?|values|47|53
187|169|Be Straightforward. Whenever we speak internally or externally we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesnt mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but its got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Dont use eight words when five will do. Be fair and do the right thing. Whats fair? Whats the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyones judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help? An example might be providing a refund even if its a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says Sure we can do that for you when a customer expected you to say sorry, we cant. If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If thats the case, dont feel badly about it. Levelheadedness. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We dont act out of spite, we dont rush to judgment, we dont jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure. Generosity. Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure we give what were expected to, and then some. Independence. This ones a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, heres one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, weve always done things our way. We dont look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward. We see things with our own eyes, make our own calls, and offer thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and products that we think are right, not that they think are right.|What is the one that breaks away from the others?|Independence|1818|1831

366|317|This is a voluntary plan fully funded by 37signals. Employees will not be taxed for this plan. This plan is effective April 1, 2019, and in effect for no less than a year and continuously thereafter. Current and future employees of 37signals LLC are eligible for this policy. The definition of Family member can be found in the WA state law RCW 50A.04.010. New child is defined as a new birth, adoption, or fostered minor. A Primary Caregiver is the person who provides the child with the majority of their care during Parental Leave. A Secondary Caregiver is a parent who is accompanied by the presence of the Primary Caregiver. In practice, one example of this policy would be one parent home full-time with a new child as a Primary Caregiver and the other parent home part-time as a Secondary Caregiver. If 70% of your pay is lower than what Washington State would pay under the state requirement, we will supplement to meet that requirement. All durations allowed in this policy are on a 52 consecutive week period. Benefits are allowed per event and do not have a total annual cap. For example, one medical event in March would not reduce the benefit for a medical event in October provided they are unrelated and occurred separately. An employee must be in employment for 820 hours during the qualifying period (Qualifying period means the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters or, if eligibility is not established, the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the application for leave). The employee must also have worked at least 340 hours for the employer during the 12 months immediately preceding the date leave will commence. An employee that had coverage under the state plan retains the state plan coverage until the employee qualifies for coverage under the employers voluntary plan. If an employee was eligible to take benefits under the approved voluntary plan of a previous employer, that employee would be immediately eligible for benefits under the current employers voluntary plan. In addition to the 12 weeks outlined in the companywide policy, as the the birthing parent you may take an additional 2 weeks of leave at $1,000 a week if pregnancy complications result in a longer recovery period. If one of your family members is under treatment or recovery for a serious medical condition and requires your care, you may take 4 weeks off at 100% pay. If after 4 weeks you need more time, you may take up to an additional 8 weeks at 70% of your pay for a total of 12 weeks.|What is the name of the company that funds the Washington state plan?|37signals|41|51
