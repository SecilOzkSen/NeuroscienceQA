See it, track it, discuss it, act on it. Tasks, discussions, deadlines, and files everythings predictably organized in Basecamp. But we want it to be more than that. In mid-2016, we decided to focus on helping small business owners manage their businesses and help alleviate growth and organizational pains theyre facing. Project management was our bread and butter for over 15 years. But we were inspired by how we, internally, have used Basecamp to run 37signals, and we want to extend that philosophy to our current customers and scores of brand-new customers.|Basecamp is a place where people can organize and discuss everything they need to get a project done.| secure
1|1|But lets take a look back. In 2003, 37signals was a web design firm made up of 4 people. We always had work, but we were disorganized. With so many concurrent projects, things began to slip through the cracks. Projects dragged on too long. We dropped the ball on key deliverables. We had some major miscommunication. As many people even still do, we relied on email for everything. Things inevitably got lost, people get left out of conversations, theres nowhere to go to see whats left to do.|What was the number of people in the company at the time?| 4
2|2|Lo and behold, our projects ran better! We regained the sense of order and calmness wed been craving. And clients noticed they really appreciated the improved communication and organization. Soon after, our clients started asking us what software we were using to run these projects. Turns out they wanted to use it for their own in-house projects! So, we polished it up and put it on the market. On February 5th, 2004, Basecamp was born, and within a year, Basecamp was generating more income for us than our web design business, so we shuttered the web design firm to focus solely on Basecamp. That original Basecamp is called Basecamp Classic, and it still retains quite a few loyal customers! In 2012, we released our second version of Basecamp, referred to as BCX.|On what date did Basecamp hit the market?| February 5th, 2004

4|4|Fast forward to 2014. Wed been feeling pulled in too many directions for too long. Campfire, Highrise, Backpack, and a host of other products were taking away from what we really wanted to do: maintain and improve Basecamp.

6|5|HEY. HEY is our love letter to email. While our internal communications are almost exclusively in Basecamp (with code reviews in GitHub the primary exception), we still correspond with some external service providers and customers via email. Every time we needed to do that, we felt the drag: how much harder it was to manage and stay on top of email. So we eventually decided to do something about it. After over two years of work, we launched HEY in June 2020.|Basecamp is where we communicate with customers and they send us emails?| Basecamp

8|7|Ta-da List. Ten years ago, to-do list apps were few and far between. So, we created Ta-da List as a stand alone free subscription app at tadalist.com in January 2005. Now that people have to-do lists on their phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and refrigerator doors, we recognized that Ta-da List was a little outdated.

9|8|Backpack. We created Backpack in May 2005 as a supplement to Basecamp Classic. Backpack existed as an organizer: a place to keep lifes loose ends together. Users could make lists, notes, add files, upload pictures, and create Writeboards to share with other users.

The 37signals Suite was a bundle of Basecamp Classic, Highrise, Backpack, and Campfire that allowed businesses to get big savings across the apps, simplify billing, and unify users across the apps. We retired the 37signals Suite offering after BCX was launched. Breeze. In 2012, we launched Echo, which turned into Breeze, a mailing list tool for small groups. We were excited about it, tried for a year to build up the product and bring in customers, but the product didnt take off like we hoped it would. Only about 1,200 customers signed up in that year, so rather than watch it limp along, we closed it down in August 2013.|What was the number of people signed up for Echo?| 1,200

So, we created and hosted WeWorkRemotely.com, which contains job postings for programmers, designers, marketing professionals, customer service representatives, writers, and more all remote work positions. We posted thousands of jobs over the years we ran WWR.

21|15|Know Your Team (formerly Know Your Company). In 2013, 37signals created a software tool that allows managers to ask questions to gain insight into what their employees think about work, the culture, the direction of the company, what people are working on, or even something personal like their favorite recent movie. We created Know Your Team because when the 37signals team grew to about 30 people, Jason realized he didnt know the company or its people as well as he should have. So, Know Your Team was created initially as an internal tool that eventually became a product that we sold to customers. In 2014, we sold Know Your Team to Claire Lew, and shes been running it ever since!|What is the name of the founder of Know Your Team?| Claire Lew

51|38|Values. Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everythings harder when we all believe different things about whats important to us, our company. Key values:. Be Straightforward. Whenever we speak internally or externally we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesnt mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but its got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Dont use eight words when five will do.|When we speak internally, we should always be straight forward.| Be Straightforward
52|39|. Be fair and do the right thing. Whats fair? Whats the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyones judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help? An example might be providing a refund even if its a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says Sure we can do that for you when a customer expected you to say sorry, we cant. If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If thats the case, dont feel badly about it.|Do you expect to help someone if they ask for help?| friend
53|40|. Levelheadedness. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large.

54|41|. Generosity. Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure we give what were expected to, and then some. Independence. This ones a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, heres one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, weve always done things our way. We dont look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward. We see things with our own eyes, make our own calls, and offer thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and products that we think are right, not that they think are right.|Since day one, weve always done things our way. We do what our way?| Independence
55|42|At some point, growing small businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they dont lose control of themselves along the way. Company-wide communication, team-based communication, and project work needs a home. Most companies cobble together a latticework of separate tools as they grow, but the weight of disorganization and lack of order collapses and eventually catches up to them. Email doesnt cut it anymore. More meetings arent going to solve the problem. And increasingly, incessant chatting creates exponentially more communication without the necessary structure and context to make it useful.|Doing what does not make a difference anymore?| Email

We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about whats reasonable and whats not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks.|This is what is the name for the work that is done on a small feature?| 1-weeker

62|48|Cooldown. In between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. Thats the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. Its sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but its helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as pencils down. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects.|How long does it take to cool down a bug?| two weeks
63|49|Communication. Its hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (Its also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work thats going on.|How many chief mechanisms are there for keeping everyone in the loop?| four
64|50|First, theres the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. Theyre a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! Youre obliged to answer this question at least twice a week.|What did you work on?| What did you work on today?,

66|51|Second, theres the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when theyre not out. Daily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you're only subscribed to your team's answers. You're of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you're not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy.|What will you be working on this week?| What will you be working on this week?,

68|52|Third, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work thats been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended.|After a cycle has ended, a team must write what?| one week after
69|53|Fourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle. |These are the team version of what?| kickoffs

71|54|These mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, its easier for everyone to build trust in where were going and why.|How many opportunities does it take for everyone to make big decisions about what to do?| six
72|55|All these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year. Pitches. Whether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches. Write-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then well have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time.|Pitches are what?| Pitches

74|56|Therell always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So its important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. Thats a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesnt make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point.|If the pitch does not make it in, it will impact other decisions by shining light on a weak point.| company) will read and consider your pitch

76|57|Asynchronously. We have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but thats a feature not a bug.

78|59|Its far better for everyones concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.|Do people who don't know what in advance have to post a message, a todo, or document about what?| a message, a todo, or a document
79|60|Dont take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and thats fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will). All that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if its a one-day turn-around every time.|Do you want to spend 15-30 minutes with people who are not working with you?| 15-30-60 minutes

81|61|In certain departments, like Support and Ops, its even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there.|What kind of job does support and Ops have a lot of?| interrupt-based
82|62|In self-sufficient, independent teams. Organizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible. Thus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth.|Projects are usually deployed as independently as possible if they are designed to do what?| idea to deploy

84|63|Similarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly. When we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too.

Dont require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us.|Do you want to have a script that can be used by any team to restore a database?| self-service
85|64|None of this means we cant talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldnt be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better. As soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for the mobile integration, were dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked. Thats a poor fit for our organizational aspirations, so we have to work to counter that.|As soon as components of a mobile integration are added to the platform, what happens to the team?| and detailed schedule management
86|65|With managers of one. We rely on everyone at 37signals to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify as managers of one, and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully. That means setting your own direction when one isnt given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. Theres always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.|Do managers of one have to work for themselves?| self-management
87|66|Balanced. We limit ourselves to a 40-hour (32-hour in the summer) work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters.

Chowder is a shorthand we use to refer to the maybes. Judo. Most problems can be solved in a thousand different ways. One way might take 100 hours, another might take 10. Judo is the art of problem restatement. Turning that massive, scary 3-month looking problem into one that can be done in 3 weeks instead.

Its a rare case when our initial aspirations for a feature dont meet the boundaries of our cycle budgets. When that happens, our go-to tool for shipping is scope hammering. This basically just means shrinking the scope, removing features or configuration or fidelity, until the work is doable within the time left. Its the opposite tactic to working longer days or weekends or to postpone the project into another cycle. Almost every project can be scope hammered, especially if you invite someone in to assist with the analysis who isnt afraid to kill other peoples darlings.

This is especially important since were a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake. Within each of our job functions, weve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Heres an example of the titles for programming:|Level up what does it mean to be a better programmer?| work

For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a $73,500 salary floor (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing).|What was the floor of the salary floor for non-technical positions in San Francisco?| $73,500
260|221|The Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If its warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, well increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We dont decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, well hold them steady until they come up again.|If the market rates are up, that is if the market rate in the top 10% has gone up, well increase pay on January 1st to follow suit?| once

There are some scheduled talks, like the welcome session on Monday morning, lightning talks, and peer appreciation session. Occasionally, we bring in outside speakers or trainers. Other than that, the meet-up is intentionally loose. Teams huddle in a breakout room, groups go out for coffee or to explore the city, or managers meet 1:1s with employees. Connection and fellowship is always the #1 goal of any meetup, which we accomplish in different ways throughout the week.|What are the two goals of a meetup?| Connection and fellowship
269|227|Meeups are 1 week long. Most people arrive Sunday, we meet Monday through Thursday, and then we travel home on Friday.

Theyre not meant to be social trips, and youre not doing just your day-to-day work in the same room as your coworkers. You should be collaborating on something meaningful. It certainly doesnt have to be big and you dont have to produce something by the end of the meet-up.
