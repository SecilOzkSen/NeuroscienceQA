This region becomes active when you think about your self and especially the emotional significance of a situation to your self. Dr. Leah Somerville and her colleagues at Harvard University found that as one grows from childhood to adolescence, the mPFC becomes more active in social situations, peaking at around fifteen years old. At this point, social situations carry a lot of emotional weight, resulting in a self-conscious stress response of high intensity. That is, in adolescence, thinking about ones self so-called self evaluation is a high priority. In contrast, an adult brain has grown accustomed to a sense of self like having broken in a new pair of shoes and as a result an adult doesnt care as much about sitting in the shop window..",

As a result of this thinning out, the volume of the prefrontal cortex reduces by about 1% per year during the teenage years. The shaping of circuits during the teen years sets us up for the lessons we learn on our paths to becoming adults.",

Its not just illness or chemicals that change us: from the movies we watch to the jobs we work, everything contributes to a continual reshaping of the neural networks we summarize as us. So who exactly are you? Is there anyone down deep, at the core? Am I the sum of my memories? Our brains and bodies change so much during our life that like a clocks hour hand its difficult to detect the changes. Every four months your red blood cells are entirely replaced, for instance, and your skin cells are replaced every few weeks. Within about seven years every atom in your body will be replaced by other atoms. Physically, you are constantly a new you.

What is the relationship between our mental experience and our physical brains? The philosopher Ren Descartes assumed that an immaterial soul exists separately from the brain. His speculation, depicted in the figure, was that sensory input feeds into the pineal gland, which serves as the gateway to the immaterial spirit. (He most likely chose the pineal gland simply because it sits on the brains midline, while most other brain features are doubled, one on each hemisphere.) The idea of an immaterial soul is easy to imagine; however, its difficult to reconcile with neuroscientific evidence. Descartes never got to wander a neurology ward. If he had, he would have seen that when brains change, peoples personalities change. Some kinds of brain damage make people depressed. Other changes make them manic. Others adjust a persons religiosity, sense of humor, or appetite for gambling. Others make a person indecisive, delusional, or aggressive. Hence the difficulty in the framework that the mental is separable from the physical.",

Both kittens got visual input from moving around inside the cylinder. But there was a critical difference in their experiences: the first kitten was walking of its own accord, while the second kitten was riding in a gondola attached to a central axis. Because of this setup, both kittens saw exactly the same thing: the stripes moved at the same time and at the same speed for both. If vision were just about the photons hitting the eyes, their visual systems should develop identically. But here was the surprising result: only the kitten that was using its body to do the moving developed normal vision. The kitten riding in the gondola never learned to see properly; its visual system never reached normal development.",

I dropped myself three times; each time was equally terrifying. On the display, numbers are generated with LED lights. Every moment, the lights that are on go off, and those that are off turn on. At slow rates of alternation, participants have no trouble reporting the numbers. But at a slightly faster rate, the positive and negative images fuse together, making the numbers impossible to see. To determine whether participants could actually see in slower motion, we dropped people with the alternation rate just slightly higher than people could normally see. If they were actually seeing in slow motion like Neo in The Matrix they would have no trouble discriminating the numbers. If not, the rate at which they can perceive the numbers should be no different than when they were on the ground. The result? We dropped twenty-three volunteers, including myself. No ones in-flight performance was better than their ground-based performance. Despite initial hopes, we were not like Neo.",

My frontal cortex deploys signals on a journey to my motor cortex, which precisely coordinates muscle contractions throughout my torso, arm, forearm, and hand so I can grasp the cup. As I touch the cup, my nerves carry back reams of information about the cups weight, its position in space, its temperature, the slipperiness of the handle, and so on. As that information streams up the spinal cord and into the brain, compensating information streams back down, passing like fast-flowing traffic on a two-way road. This information emerges from a complex choreography between parts of my brain with names like basal ganglia, cerebellum, somatosensory cortex, and many more. In fractions of a second, adjustments are made to the force with which Im lifting and the strength of my grip. Through intensive calculations and feedback, I adjust my muscles to keep the cup level as I smoothly move it on its long arc upward. I make micro-adjustments all along the way, and as it approaches my lips I tilt the cup just enough to extract some liquid without scalding myself..",

But synaptic connections are not all of the same strength: depending on their history of activity, they can become stronger or weaker. As synapses change their potency, information flows through the network differently. If a connection gets weak enough, it withers and goes away. If it gets strengthened, it can sprout new connections. Some of this reconfiguring is guided by reward systems, which globally broadcast a neurotransmitter called dopamine when something has gone well. Austins brain networks have been reshaped very slowly, very subtly by the success or failure of each attempted move, over hundreds of hours of practice..",

The next time youre in a conversation, notice the way words spill out of your mouth more quickly than you could possibly consciously control every word you say. Your brain is working behind the scenes, crafting and producing language, conjugations, and complex thoughts for you. (For comparison, compare your speed when speaking a foreign language that youre just learning!) The same behind-the-scenes work is true of ideas. We take conscious credit for all our ideas, as though weve done the hard work in generating them. But in fact, your unconscious brain has been working on those ideas consolidating memories, trying out new combinations, evaluating the consequences for hours or months before the idea rises to your awareness and you declare, I just thought of something! The man who first began to illuminate the hidden depths of the unconscious was one of the most influential scientists of the twentieth century. Sigmund Freud entered medical school in Vienna in 1873, and specialized in neurology. When he opened his private practice for the treatment of psychological disorders, he realized that often his patients had no conscious knowledge of what was driving their behavior. Freuds insight was that much of their behavior was a product of unseen mental processes. This simple idea transformed psychiatry, ushering in a new way of understanding human drives and emotions.",

Our brains constantly pull information from the environment and use it to steer our behavior, but often the influences around us are not recognized. Take an effect called priming, in which one thing influences the perception of something else. For example, if youre holding a warm drink youll describe your relationship with a family member more favorably; when youre holding a cold drink, youll express a slightly poorer opinion of the relationship. Why does this happen? Because the brain mechanisms for judging intrapersonal warmth overlap with the mechanisms for judging physical warmth, and so one influences the other. The upshot is that your opinion about something as fundamental as your relationship with your mother can be manipulated by whether you take your tea hot or iced. Similarly, when you are in a foul-smelling environment, youll make harsher moral decisions for example, youre more likely to judge that someone elses uncommon actions are immoral. In another study, it was shown that if you sit in a hard chair youll be a more hard-line negotiator in a business transaction; in a soft chair youll yield more..",

There is no obligation for you to turn one way or the other, but today, at this moment, you feel like you want to turn right. So you turn right. But why did you turn right, and not left? Because you felt like it? Or because inaccessible mechanisms in your brain decided it for you? Consider this: the neural signals that move your arms to turn the steering wheel come from your motor cortex, but those signals dont originate there. Theyre driven by other regions of the frontal lobe, which are in turn driven by many other parts of the brain, and so on in a complex linkage that criss-crosses the brains entire network. There is never a time zero when you decide to do something, because every neuron in the brain is driven by other neurons; there seems to be no part of the system that acts independently rather than reacts dependably.",

Then you notice that theres a lever nearby that can divert the trolley onto another track. But hang on! You see that theres one worker on that track. So if you pull the lever, one worker will be killed; if you dont, four will be killed. Do you pull the lever? The trolley dilemma. When people are asked what they would do in this scenario, almost everyone pulls the lever. After all, its far better that only one person is killed rather than four, right? Now consider a slightly different, second scenario. The situation begins with the same premise: a trolley is barreling down the tracks, out of control, and four workers are going to be killed.

Water is a reward when your body is getting dehydrated; food is a reward when your energy stores are running down. Water and food are called primary rewards, which directly address biological needs. More generally, however, human behavior is steered by secondary rewards, which are things that predict primary rewards. For example, the sight of a metal rectangle wouldnt by itself do much for your brain, but because youve learned to recognize it as a water fountain, then the sight of it comes to be rewarding when you are thirsty. In the case of humans, we can find even very abstract concepts rewarding, such as the feeling that we are valued by our local community. And unlike animals, we can often put these rewards ahead of biological needs. As Read Montague points out, sharks dont go on hunger strikes: the rest of the animal kingdom only chases its basic needs, while only humans regularly override those needs in deference to abstract ideals.",

The grant carries different sorts of rewards: not only money for the laboratory, but more generally the kudos from my department chairman and a rewarding sense of accomplishment in my career.

In ongoing experiments in my lab, we put Karen into the brain scanner (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI). We show her pictures of crack cocaine, and ask her to crave. Thats easy for her to do, and it activates particular regions of her brain that we summarize as the craving network. Then we ask her to suppress her craving.

The program pays particular attention to their young, developing brains. As we saw in Chapter 1, without a fully developed prefrontal cortex, decisions are often made impulsively, without meaningful consideration of future consequences. At Mendota, this viewpoint illuminates an approach to rehabilitation. To help the children improve their self-control, the program provides a system of mentoring, counseling, and rewards. An important technique is to train them to pause and consider the future outcome of any choice they might make encouraging them to run simulations of what might happen thereby strengthening neural connections that can override the immediate gratification of impulses.",

The circle slowly sneaks back into a rectangular structure and closes it behind; meanwhile, the large triangle chases the smaller triangle away. The large triangle then comes to the door of the structure, menacingly. The triangle pries the door open and comes in after the circle, who frenetically (and unsuccessfully) looks for other ways to escape. Just when the situation looks its darkest, the little triangle returns. He pulls open the door and the circle dashes out to meet him. Together they shut the door behind them, trapping the large triangle inside. Penned in, the large triangle smashes against the walls of the structure. Outside, the little triangle and circle spin around one another..",

However, even while surrounded by legendary rock and roll excess, his outlook remained different from others. When people would ask him about the different musicians and what they were like, John would respond by explaining how they had played Sun Coliseum with seven base amps chained together. He would explain that there were 2,200 watts in the bass system, and could enumerate the amplifiers and what the crossover frequencies were. But he couldnt tell you a thing about the musicians who sang through them. He lived in a world of technology and equipment. It wasnt until he was forty that John was diagnosed with Aspergers, a form of autism.",

A team led by Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone was using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess how activity in one area of the brain affected activity in another area. TMS emits a strong magnetic pulse next to the head, which in turn induces a small electric current in the brain, temporarily disrupting local brain activity. The experiment was meant to help the researchers gain greater knowledge about the autistic brain. The team used TMS to target different regions of Johns brain involved in higher-order cognitive function. At first, John reported the stimulation had no effect. But in one session, the researchers applied TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an evolutionarily recent part of the brain involved in flexible thinking and abstraction. John reported that he somehow became different.",

That observation leads to the idea of group selection. Heres the concept: if a group is composed entirely of people who cooperate, everyone in the group will be better off for it. On average, youll fare better than other people who arent very cooperative with their neighbors. Together, the members of a group can help each other to survive. Theyre safer, more productive, and better able to overcome challenges. This drive to bond with others is called eusociality (eu is Greek for good), and it provides a glue, irrespective of kinship, that allows the building of tribes, groups, and nations. Its not that individual selection doesnt occur; its just that it doesnt provide the complete picture. Although humans are competitive and individualistic much of the time, its also the case that we spend quite a bit of our lives cooperating for the good of the group. This has allowed human populations to thrive across the planet, and to build societies and civilizations feats that individuals, no matter how fit, could never pull off in isolation. Real progress is only possible with alliances that become confederations, and our eusociality is one of the major factors in the richness and complexity of our modern world.",

The part that haunts him the most is this: the continuation of the killings, of torture, was perpetrated by our neighbors the very people we had been living with for decades. They were capable of killing their own school friends. To exemplify the ways in which normal social interaction broke down, he told me how Serbs arrested a Bosniak dentist.

The neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried points out that when you look across violent events all over the world, you find the same character of behavior everywhere. Its as though people shift from their normal brain function to act in a specific way. In the same way a physician can look for coughing and fever with pneumonia, he suggested that one can look for and identify particular behaviors that characterize perpetrators in violent situations and he named this Syndrome E. In Frieds framework, Syndrome E is characterized by a diminished emotional reactivity, which allows repetitive acts of violence. It also includes hyperarousal, or as the Germans call it, Rausch a feeling of elation in doing these acts. Theres group contagion: everybodys doing it, and it catches on and spreads. Theres compartmentalization, in which somebody can care about his own family, and yet perform violence on someone elses family.",

Instead, a perpetrators choices are now fueled by parts of the brain that underpin logic and memory and reasoning and so on, but not the networks that involve emotional consideration of what it is like to be someone else.

When a hand was randomly selected, it expanded to the middle of the screen and was then touched with the cotton swab or stabbed with the syringe needle. Our experimental question was this: would your brain care as much when seeing a member of an outgroup getting hurt? We found a good deal of individual variability, but on average, peoples brains showed a larger empathic response when they saw someone in their ingroup in pain, and less of a response when it was a member of one of their outgroups. The result is especially remarkable given that these were simply one-word labels: it takes very little to establish group membership.",

Today we enjoy mundane experiences that our ancestors could never have dreamed of. We have clean rivers that we can call into our well-adorned caves when we desire. We hold small rock-sized devices that contain the knowledge of the world. We regularly see the tops of clouds and the curvature of our home planet from space. We send messages to the other side of the globe in eighty milliseconds and upload files to a floating space colony of humans at sixty megabits per second. Even when simply driving to work, we routinely move at speeds that outstrip biologys great masterpieces, such as cheetahs. Our species owes its runaway success to the special properties of the three pounds of matter stored inside our skulls.",

The implant picks up sounds from the outside world and passes them to the auditory nerve by means of sixteen tiny electrodes. The experience of hearing doesnt arrive immediately: people have to learn to interpret the foreign dialect of the signals fed to the brain. As one cochlear implant recipient, Michael Chorost, describes his experience: When the device was turned on a month after surgery, the first sentence I heard sounded like Zzzzzz szz szvizzz ur brfzzzzzz? My brain gradually learned how to interpret the alien signal. Before long, Zzzzzz szz szvizzz ur brfzzzzzz? became What did you have for breakfast? After months of practice, I could use the telephone again, even converse in loud bars and cafeterias. Retinal implants work on similar principles. The tiny electrodes of the retinal implant bypass the normal functions of the photoreceptor sheet, sending out their tiny sparks of electrical activity. These implants are used mostly for eye diseases in which the photoreceptors at the back of the eye are degenerating, but in which the cells of the optic nerve remain healthy. Even though the signals sent by the implant are not precisely what the visual system is used to, the downstream processes are able to learn to extract the information they need for vision.",

Moores prediction has held true through the intervening decades, and has become shorthand for the exponentially accelerating pace of technological change. Moores Law is used by the computing industry to guide long-term planning and set goals for technological advancement. Because the law predicts that technological progress will increase exponentially rather than linearly, some predict that at todays rate there will be 20,000 years worth of progress in the next hundred years. At this pace we can expect to see radical advancements in the technology that we rely on..",

Would it think and be self- aware? Does consciousness require the physical stuff? In the same way that computer software can run on different hardware, it may be that the software of the mind can run on other platforms as well. Consider the possibility this way: what if there is nothing special about biological neurons themselves, and instead its only how they communicate that makes a person who they are? That prospect is known as the computational hypothesis of the brain. The idea is that the neurons and synapses and other biological matter arent the critical ingredients: its the computations they happen to be implementing. It may be that what the brain physically is doesnt matter, but instead what it does..",

Or might it be possible to create a different kind of intelligence, of our own invention, from scratch? Artificial intelligence People have been trying for a long time to create machines that think. That line of research artificial intelligence has been around since at least the 1950s. Although the initial pioneers were heady with optimism, the problem has turned out to be unexpectedly difficult. Although well soon have cars that drive themselves, and its almost two decades since a computer first beat a chess grand master, the goal of a truly sentient machine still waits to be achieved. When I was a child, I expected that we would have robots interacting with us by now, taking care of us and engaging in meaningful conversation. The fact that were still quite distant from that outcome speaks to the depth of the enigma of how the brain functions, and how far we still have to go to decode Mother Natures secrets.",

But what if robots could develop the way a human infant does by interacting with the world, by imitating and learning by example? After all, babies dont come into the world knowing how to speak and walk but they come with curiosity and they pay attention and they imitate. Babies use the world theyre in as a textbook to learn by example. Couldnt a robot do the same? The iCub is about the size of a two-year-old. It has eyes and ears and touch sensors, and these allow it to interact with and learn about the world..",

The scale of interaction in a city is on a par with the human brain. Of course, it would be very hard to know if a city were conscious. How could it tell us? How could we ask it? To answer a question like this requires a deeper question: for a network to experience consciousness, does it need more than just a number of parts but instead a very particular structure to the interactions? Professor Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin is working to answer exactly that question. He has proposed a quantitative definition of consciousness. Its not enough, he thinks, that there are pieces and parts interacting. Instead, there has to be a certain organization underlying this interaction.",

We would need not only the pieces and parts, but also the physics of their ongoing interactions for example, the activity of transcription factors that travel to the nucleus and cause gene expression, the dynamic changes in location and strength of the synapses, and so on. Unless your simulated experiences changed the structure of your simulated brain, you would be unable to form new memories and would have no sense of the passage of time. Under those circumstances, would there be any point to immortality? If uploading proves to be possible, it would open up the capacity to reach other solar systems. There are at least a hundred billion other galaxies in our cosmos, each of which contains a hundred billion stars. Weve already spotted thousands of exoplanets orbiting those stars, some of which have conditions quite like our Earth. The difficulty lies in the impossibility that our current fleshy bodies will ever get to those exoplanets theres simply no foreseeable way that we will be able to travel those kinds of distances in space and time. However, because you can pause a simulation, shoot it out into space, and reboot it a thousand years later when it arrives at a planet, it would seem to your consciousness that you were on Earth, you had a launch, and then instantly you found yourself on a new planet. Uploading would be equivalent to achieving the physics dream of finding a wormhole, allowing us to get from one part of the universe to another in a subjective instant..",

Heres the strange part: if you die and we turn on the simulation one second later, it would be a transfer. It would be no different to beaming up in Star Trek, when a person is disintigrated, and then a new version is reconstituted a moment later. Uploading may not be all that different from what happens to you each night when you go to sleep: you experience a little death of your consciousness, and the person who wakes up on your pillow the next morning inherits all your memories, and believes him or herself to be you.",

I never cease to be astonished by how perceptive they are to shifting patterns of emotion, color, luminance, setting, and tone. Together, we had the pleasure of working with connoisseurs of the visual world, directors of photography Duane McClune, Andy Jackson, and Mark Schwartzbard.

Consider this scenario proposed by philosopher Peter Singer: as youre about to tuck into a sandwich, you look out the window and see a child on the sidewalk, starving, a tear running down his gaunt cheek.

But right now, in Africa, there is that same child, starving, just like the boy on the corner. All it would take is a click of your mouse to send $5, the equivalent cost of that sandwich. Yet its likely that you havent sent over any sandwich money to him today, or even recently, despite your charitableness in the first scenario. Why havent you acted to help him? Its because the first scenario puts the child right in front of you. The second requires you to imagine the child..",
