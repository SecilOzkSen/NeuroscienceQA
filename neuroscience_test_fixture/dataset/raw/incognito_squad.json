          "context": "This book introduces new and provocative neuroscience research that advances our understanding of intelligence and the brain. Compelling evidence shows that genetics play a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function. He dispels common misconceptions such as the belief that IQ tests are biased or meaningless and debunks simple interventions alleged to increase intelligence. Readers will learn about the real possibility of dramatically enhancing intelligence based on neuroscience findings and the positive implications this could have for education and social policy. The text also explores potential controversies surrounding neuro-poverty, neuro- social-economic status, and the morality of enhancing intelligence for everyone. Online resources, including additional visuals, animations, questions and links, reinforce the",

On one hand, this account is an introduction to the field that presupposes no special background; on the other hand, it is more in-depth than popularized accounts in the mass/social media. My emphasis is on explaining the science of intelligence in understandable language. The viewpoint that suffuses every chapter is that intelligence is 100% a biological phenomenon, genetic or not, influenced by environment or not, and that the relevant biology takes place in the brain. That is why there is a neuroscience of intelligence to write about.",

Surely, most people would agree that increasing intelligence is a positive goal for helping people in the lower-than-normal range who often cannot learn basic self-care routines or employment skills.

Drafts of this book were read all or in part by Rosalind Arden, Roberto Colom, Doug Detterman, George Goodfellow, Earl Hunt, Rex Jung, Sherif Karama, Marty Nemko, Aljoscha Neubauer, Yulia Kovas, and Lars Penke. Their corrections and insights were invaluable; any remaining errors are mine. Although I have included a substantial number of citations to relevant work, I could not possibility include everything I would have liked to. In fact, the field is moving so quickly, I added newly published papers right up to the last days before my deadline. I apologize to anyone who feels his or her work was left out. Some topics, explanations, and illustrations in this book were included in a set of my video lectures, The Intelligence Brain (2013 The Teaching Company, LLC: www.thegreatcourses.com). Most of all, my wife protected my work time against all",

Why can some people memorize exceptionally long strings of random numbers or tell the day of the week on any date in the past, present, or future? What is artistic genius and is it related to intelligence? These are some of the challenges to defining intelligence for research. It is obvious that no matter how you define intelligence, it must have something to do with the brain. Among the many myths about intelligence, perhaps the most pernicious is that intelligence is a concept too amorphous and ill-defined for scientific study. In fact, the definitions and measures used for research are sufficiently developed for empirical investigations and have been so for over 100 years. This long research tradition used various kinds of mental ability tests and sophisticated statistical methods known collectively as psychometrics. The new science of intelligence builds on that database and melds it with new technologies of the last two decades or so, especially genetic and neuroimaging methods. These advances, the main focus of this book, are helping evolve a more neuroscience-oriented approach to intelligence research. The trajectory of this research is similar to that in other scientific fields, which has led from better measurement tools to more sophisticated definitions and understandings of, for example, an atom and a gene. Before we address the brain in subsequent chapters, this chapter reviews the current state of basic intelligence research issues regarding the definition of intelligence as a general mental ability, the measurement of intelligence relative to other people, and the validity of intelligence test scores for",

When we add points on the graph for each person, we begin to see an association. Taller people tend to weigh more. You can see this in Figure 1.2. This association is obvious without needing to plot the points, but associations between other variables are not so obvious. Moreover, correlations quantify the strength of association.",

A German psychologist named William Stern took the concept of mental age a step further. He divided mental age by chronological age. This resulted in an IQ score that was the ratio of a childs mental age (averaged across all the subtests) divided by the childs chronological age. Multiplying this ratio by 100 avoided fractions.",

This is shown in the illustration of IQ scores where the mean score is 100 and the standard deviation is 15 points. Standard deviations show the degree of spread around the mean and are calculated as a function of how much each person deviates from the group mean. In a normal distribution, 50% of people score below 100. Sixty-eight percent of individuals fall between plus one and minus one standard deviations so scores between 85 and 115 are regarded as the range of average IQ.

Younger test takers may average 8 points if they are 10 years old, and older people taking the same test, say at age 12, may average a score of 14 points. This is why its important to have norm groups for each age. Ifa new 12-year-old takes the subtest and scores 14, he is scoring at the average for his age. If he scores above or below 14, the deviation from the norm average can be calculated and his score can be expressed by how much it deviates from the mean. The average deviation across all the subtests is used to calculate the deviation IQ for the full battery. As illustrated, deviation scores are easily convertible into percentiles.",

Interestingly, the SAT originally was called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, then it was renamed the Scholastic Achievement Test, and now its called the Scholastic Assessment Test. Achievement tests measure what you have learned. Aptitude tests measure what you might learn, especially in a specific area like, for example, music or foreign language. It turns out that the SAT, especially the overall total score, is a good estimator of g because the problems require reasoning (Frey & Detterman, 2004). Like IQ scores, SAT scores are normally distributed and interpreted best as percentiles. For example, people in the top 2% of the SAT distribution tend to be in at least the top 2% of the IQ distribution. Sometimes, this surprises people, but why should intelligence not be related to how much someone learns?",

A spatial ability test, for example, may have a different mean for men and women, but that does not make the test biased. If scores for men and for women predict spatial ability equally well, the test is not biased even if there is a mean difference. Note that a few cases of incorrect prediction do",

Ten miles is twice the distance of five miles. This is not the case for IQ scores. A person with an IQ score of 140 is not literally twice as smart as a person with a score of 70. Even if you believe you have encountered at least one person with zero intelligence, zero is certainly not the case. For IQ, its the percentile that counts. Someone with an IQ of 140 is in the top 1% and someone with a score of 70 is in the bottom 2%. A person with an IQ of 130 is not 30% smarter than a person whose score is 100.

A large study conducted by the US Air Force, for example, found that g predicted virtually all the variance in pilot performance (Ree & Carretta, 1996; Ree & Earles, 1991). Most of us are not pilots, but in general, lower IQ is sufficient for jobs that require a mimmum of complex, independent reasoning. The jobs tend to follow specific routines like assembling a simple product, food service, or nurses aid. IQs around 100 are necessary for more complex jobs like bank teller and police officer. Successful managers, teachers, accountants, and others in similar professions usually have IQs of at least 115. Professions like attorney, chemist, doctor, engineer, and business executive usually require higher IQs to finish the advanced schooling that is required and to perform at a high level of complexity.",

Thats 1,250 8-hour days, or about 3.4 years. This implies that expertise can be achieved in any field with this level of practice irrespective of intelligence or talent. Studies of chess grandmasters, for example, report the group average IQ is about 100. This suggests that becoming a grandmaster may depend more on practice of a specific ability like spatial memory than on general intelligence. Grandmasters may actually have a savant-like spatial memory, but the idea of a chess grandmaster being a super all-purpose giant intellect is not necessarily correct. Many studies refute the idea that 10,000 hours of practice can lead to expertise if there is no pre-existing talent to build on (Detterman, 2014; Ericsson, 2014; Grabner, 2014; Grabner et al., 2007; Plomin et al., 2014a, 201 4b).",

It was true as early civilizations developed and great thinkers (likely with high g) solved even more complex problems (e.g. just how does one build a seaworthy ship or a pyramid?). And it is still true today as we grapple with connecting our new television sets and audio systems with HDMI cables or using all the functions in our word processor or on our smart phones or digital cameras beyond the auto mode. Do you know how to use the scanners in the self-checkout lines at the supermarket or do you wait in a long slow line for a human cashier? How much do you understand about money management and investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds? Do you do your own taxes? Many people grapple daily with the challenges of navigating nearly impenetrable systems for healthcare, social support, or justice. Poverty presents a myriad of daily problems to solve.

The risk is 7.5 times greater in the low group for incarceration, and 6.2 times more for living in poverty. Unemployment and even divorce are a bit more likely in the low group. IQ even predicts traffic accidents. In the high IQ group, the death rate from traffic accidents is about 51 per 10,000 drivers, but in the low IQ group, this almost triples to about 147.

Therefore, people in the bottom part of the normal distribution of IQ (a normal distribution is also called a bell curve because of its shape) will be at a serious disadvantage for succeeding, especially in school and some vocations. Herrnstein had introduced this theme in an earlier book, JQ in The Meritocracy (Herrnstein, 1973) that also generated considerable acrimony. Read the detailed description of hostility on the Harvard campus recounted in the Preface to get a sense of the times; a few years later another Harvard professor, Edward O. Wilson, encountered similar outrage when he proposed the concept of sociobiology (Wilson, 1975). The Bell Curve continued the argument with over 900 pages of data and statistical analyses mostly comparing high- and low-intelligence groups, but the one chapter that discussed black/white IQ differences aroused the fiercest controversy (please note that the terms black and white are used here because most of the research, from America and other countries, uses these terms). This issue of group differences haunts all intelligence research and I refer the reader to in- depth accounts of the complexities involved (see Further Reading).",

This is a fundamental issue today in politics although the role of intelligence is hardly mentioned as explicitly as it was in The Bell Curve. Most researchers would agree that research data on intelligence can only inform policy decisions, but the goals of the policy need to be determined through democratic means; we return to this issue in Section 6.6. Unfortunately, psychometric research on intelligence has often been portrayed as damaging to a progressive social agenda because there are substantial average test score differences among some racial and ethnic groups. These relative average group differences often motivate a general disregard for empirical research on intelligence although neuroscience approaches are advancing the field, as the next chapters discuss. Before we get to those, lets continue with more data about IQ",

This is the same Lewis Terman who brought Binets IQ test to the USA and revised it into the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. Terman designed a straightforward study. It started by testing many school children with the StanfordBinet test. Children with very high IQ scores were selected and then studied extensively for decades. Termans study had two goals: to find the traits that characterized high-IQ children, and to see what kind of adults they would become. The common stereotype of intelligent adults was not so different then as it is now. Francis Galton, for example, wrote in his 1884 book, Hereditary Genius (Galton & Prinzmetal, 1884): There is a prevalent belief that men of genius are unhealthy, puny beings all brain and no muscle weak- sighted, and generally of poor constitutions...

However, further follow-up indicated that high IQ alone did not necessarily predict life success. Motivation was also important, and Terman believed that while genes played an important role in high IQ, he also believed that exceptional ability required exceptional education to maximize a students potential. This may not sound so radical, but even today there is a debate about whether any education resources at all should be allocated to the most gifted students to develop their high ability.",

Similarly, there are no data about minorities. Do these problems invalidate the main findings? Not likely.

Dr. Stanley started working with a precocious student, and after he gave the student a battery of psychometric tests, Dr. Stanley helped the student get into Hopkins at the early age of 13. Dr. Stanley subsequently referred to this young man as the first Radical Accelerant, identified as Joseph B. In his first year at Hopkins, at age 13, Joseph took honors calculus, sophomore physics, and computer science, and his grade point average was 3.69 out of 4.0. He lived at home during this time but he also made friends with other college students and adjusted well to his accelerated studies. In four years, he received a BA and an MS degree in computer science. He began a PhD program in computer science at Cornell before he was 18 years old, and Joseph went on to have a productive career.",

So was born the idea of using the SAT-Math test for screening junior high school students to find precocious individuals with talent for math and science. The Spencer Foundation provided multiple year funding to Dr. Stanley beginning in 1971 and the first talent search was in 1972. For that search, junior high school students in the Baltimore area had to be nominated by their math teachers to participate. Actual SAT-Math tests were given in the standard way. In that first search, 396 7th and 8th grade students took the SAT-Math. Here are two fascinating results of that first talent search. Twenty-two of the 396 scored at least 660, which was higher than the average Hopkins freshman at the time. And, all of these 22 were boys and none of the 173 girls scored over 600.",

You can see that more women are alive in the highest IQ quartile, about 70%, compared to the bottom quartile, where about 45% are still alive. This is quite a large difference. And this is true starting around age 20. Its the same for men, but starting later around age 40 and the trend is not quite as strong. Because the UK has universal healthcare, differential rates of insurance coverage do not influence these data. But why should IQ be related to longevity? Here is one possible explanation. Before age 11, several factors, both genetic and environmental, may influence IQ and then higher IQ leads to healthier environments and behaviors, and to a possibly better understanding of physician instructions, and these in turn influence age at death. However, there is compelling evidence that a better explanation is that mortality and IQ have genetic influences in common. An estimated 84%95% of the variance in the mortality/IQ correlation may be due to genes (Arden ef al., 2015).",

          "context": "Given all this strong empirical evidence that intelligence test scores are meaningful, why does the myth persist that scores have little if any validity? Here is an informative example. From time to time, a college admissions representative will assert that in their institution they find no relationship between grade point average (GPA) and SAT scores. Such observations are virtually always based on a lack of understanding of a basic statistical principle regarding the correlation between two variables. To calculate a correlation between any two variables, there must be a wide range of scores for each variable. At a place like MIT, for example, most students fall in a narrow range of high SAT scores. This is a classic problem of restriction of range. There is little variance among the students, so in this case, the relationship between GPA and SAT scores will not be very strong. Sampling from just the high end or just the low end or just the middle of a distribution restricts range and results in spuriously low or zero correlations. Restriction of range actually accounts for many findings about what intelligence test scores fail to predict. Heres another classic example of an erroneous finding due to restriction of range. In the 1930s Louis Thurstone challenged Spearmans finding of a g-factor (Thurstone, 1938) and proposed an alternative model of seven Primary Abilities that he claimed were independent of each other. That is, they were not correlated to each other and there was no common g-factor. Theres Spatial Ability as measured by tests that require mental rotation of pictures and objects.

We now have hundreds of factor analysis studies of intelligence on hundreds of mental tests completed by tens of thousands of people and using many varieties of factor analysis method. The bottom line is that there always is a g-factor. Heres a key point: g- factors derived from different test batteries correlate nearly perfectly with each other as long as each battery has a sufficient number of tests that sample a broad range of mental abilities, and the tests are given to people sampled from the wide range of ability (Johnson et al., 2004, 2008b). A recent study of 180 college students reported that a g-factor derived from their performance on a battery of video games correlated highly (0.93) with a g-factor extracted from their performance on a battery of cognitive tests (Angeles Quiroga et al., 2015). Such studies provide strong evidence that g is not a statistical artifact, even though its meaning is limited as an interval scale. And, logically, if it were merely an artifact, g scores would not correlate with other measures of the complexity of everyday life, as we noted, nor with genetic and brain parameters, as we detail in subsequent chapters.",

Its hard to apportion intelligence variance to just genes when complex interactions with environments are part of the mix. Epigenetics is a relatively new field, but there are already some promising indications of progress. A longitudinal study of Romanian orphans, for example, has identified risk for cognitive and psychiatric problems partially attributable to the extreme social deprivation in early life experience. DNA analyses indicate specific genetic alterations are related to the degree of deprivation (Drury et al., 2012). Animal research suggests that some changes in gene expression related to environmental factors may actually be heritable (Champagne & Curley, 2009). This is exciting research, but so far there is no direct connection to human intelligence, although there is considerable emerging research on the epigenetics of memory (Heyward & Sweatt, 2015). Environmental variables like exposure to language in early childhood (Kuhl, 2000, 2004) influence brain neurobiology and development, but",

In this view, whatever role genes might play is minimized, and some even argue for a zero contribution of genes. Although this view about the importance of early environment seems reasonable, and even flattering to proud parents, the evidence for strong environmental effects on intelligence, especially in early childhood, is surprisingly weak, as we will see. Epigenetics provides a concept for the continued consideration of theories about the importance of environmental factors for intelligence, but epigenetic research on intelligence is just beginning (Haggarty ef al., 2010). Nonetheless, like climate change, the data that support a major genetic component to intelligence are compelling and the number of genetic deniers and minimizers is diminishing rapidly.",

A similar effort in the 1960s and 1970s regarding the myth of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders has all but disappeared. Much of the anti-genetic feeling originally arose as a moral response to eugenic movements in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the aftermath of Nazi atrocities during the 1930s and 1940s, and most recently",

The former, with roots in Mendels experiments with peas, deals with establishing whether a genetic component (a genotype) may exist or not for a behavior or characteristic (the phenotype) and if so, how much variance can be accounted for by genes. Quantitative genetics includes modeling a mode of gene transmission (e.g., dominant or recessive). Twin and adoption studies are primary methods of quantitative genetics and we will review key studies and some surprising findings that support a strong role for genes and a minimal role for environmental variables in explaining intelligence differences among individuals. Molecular genetics is a newer field and uses various DNA technologies and methods to identify genes that are related to variation in specific traits and, in the case of intelligence, how those genes work to influence brain development and brain function. This ambition is as complex as any goal in any scientific field. Molecular genetic findings related to intelligence so far are quite tentative with little replication of specific genes identified as possibly related to intelligence. Nonetheless, there is progress and the findings reviewed later in this chapter are somewhere between intriguing and amazing.",

Such opportunities were virtually unavailable to the poor, especially prior to the 1954 Supreme Court decision striking down race-based separate but equal approaches to education. The solution for eliminating any cognitive gaps seemed obvious and the idea of compensatory education resulted in the federally funded Head Start Program. Prior to Head Start, several different compensatory education demonstration projects had been implemented on a limited basis. Some of these projects were reporting encouraging and even dramatic positive results at reducing cognitive gaps and increasing IQ scores.

Jensens article (1969) was entitled, How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement? Here is the opening sentence: Compensatory education has been tried and it apparently has failed. Jensen continued with over 100 pages of detailed analysis of intelligence research that revealed little if any lasting effect of the early compensatory efforts on either IQ scores or school achievement. That alone was bad enough in the political context of widespread enthusiasm for the nascent Head Start Program, but the article got worse when Jensen discussed genetics. He first reviewed studies of environmental effects on intelligence. He concluded that the empirical evidence for any major environmental effects on intelligence in general, and especially for the g-factor, was actually quite weak. He then argued that one reason for this would be that variance in intelligence, especially the g-factor, was mostly genetic. He summarized genetic studies that appeared to validate this view. In 1969, this conclusion was a bit of a stretch given the paucity of both environmental and genetic studies with large samples and solid research designs. However, the article, already offensive to the majority view that intelligence derived mostly from environment, went even further with a controversial suggestion, and controversial is an understatement.",

The most vicious responses were directed to the inflammatory inference that blacks were intellectually inferior because of their genetic makeup and to the general idea that genes played a major role in intelligence and the environment did not. Jensens concluding paragraphs about the importance of adjusting teaching methods to match the learning capabilities of individual students to maximize school achievement for all children received virtually no attention (see Section 6.6). In any case, critics have spent decades attacking Jensen personally and his arguments. As mentioned briefly in the last chapter, another book published in 1973, JO in the Meritocracy (Herrnstein, 1973) created a similar firestorm regarding the role of genetics in intelligence. Given the racial inferences and the hot emotional atmosphere, few researchers or their students opted to focus their careers on any questions at all about intelligence. Getting federal research support for researching intelligence became virtually impossible. Almost overnight, intelligence research became radioactive.",

In the 1970s and 1980s, Jensens critics attacked the validity of IQ tests and scores, the existence of the g-factor, quantitative genetics in principle, and even the integrity and motivation of individual researchers. One simple argument was that any average group differences in intelligence test scores were most likely due to test bias and had no meaning. The bias hypothesis, as noted in the previous chapter, has been studied extensively and has little empirical support. As far as test scores being without real meaning, there is extensive evidence, as noted in Chapter 1, that scores predict many aspects of life (Deary eft al., 2010; Gottfredson, 1997b). Moreover, in the next two chapters, neuroimaging shows that intelligence test scores are correlated to a variety of structural and functional measures of the brain; findings that would be impossible if the test scores were meaningless. Some critics challenged whether the g-",

The modern neuroscience studies that are the focus of this book have helped the field move beyond these old destructive controversies. While the basis of average group differences on psychometric tests of intelligence and other cognitive abilities is still unsettled, the major role of genetics for explaining intelligence differences among individuals is firmly established, as detailed in the next section. It is also the case that the weight of evidence from modern studies of intensive compensatory education, now rebranded as early childhood education, still fails to find lasting effects on IQ scores and even short-lived increases are not clearly related to the g-factor (te Nijenhuis et a/., 2014). Contrary to Jensens review, newer, more intensive studies indicate that some important aspects of academic achievement, like graduation rates, apparently do improve (Barnett & Hustedt, 2005; Campbell et al., 2001; Ramey & Ramey, 2004).

David Rosenthal was one of the principle investigators for the Denmark studies and I worked in his laboratory at The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in my first job after graduate school. He once told me that although these studies did not elucidate much about schizophrenia other than a genetic component of some kind was involved, the beauty of the adoption study design was its simplicity. Basically, only two simple numbers counted. Anybody can see a higher rate of schizophrenia in the one group compared to the other, so in this case, it was hard to deny some role for genetics (although some anti-genetic critics certainly tried).",

They argued that the same correlation value to three decimal places based on different sample sizes was statistically improbable.

In the wake of the fraud charges, Jensen, who knew Burt (who died in 1971), examined Burts original data files and found a number of serious concerns that he reported in detail (Jensen, 1974). Jensen was willing to exclude Burts data from his argument, but still maintained that other data supported a role for genetic influences on intelligence. Most independent investigations of Burts data doubt the claim of intentional fraud (Mackintosh, 1995). We may never know for sure, but the main point is this.",

The most common view was about 50-50. However, there is considerable variability among studies regarding this proportion and theres an interesting factor that accounts for much of this variability.

In other words, the genetic influences on intelligence variance actually increase with age and environmental influences decrease. Note that cross- sectional means that different twin pairs participated in different studies at different times. Suppose we followed the same twins and retested them periodically as they got older. Would we see the same trend in such longitudinal data? The answer is yes. In a large Dutch twin study (Posthuma ef al., 2003b), the same identical twins were given mental test batteries repeatedly over time to assess general intelligence. The heritability estimate of general intelligence was 26% at age 5, 39% at age 7, 54% at age 10, 64% at age 12, and starting at age 18 the estimate grew to over 80%.

These findings are extraordinary and among the most powerful and important in all of psychology. They are difficult to explain if you are convinced that genes are unimportant for intelligence. They also give pause to the idea that enriching childhood family experiences, as pleasant as they may be for many good reasons, has a lasting effect on the development of intelligence. However, these data also show that both shared and non-shared environment have effects at different developmental stages and in different amounts, especially before age 18. They are just not as strong as was once believed, but they demonstrate clearly that genes alone are not the whole story. All genetic researchers know that genes always express their function within an environmental context that may influence expression in many ways. Specific sources of these non-genetic effects on intelligence are not yet determined, just like specific genes are not yet identified, although general factors like schooling have some influence (Ceci, 1991; Ceci & Williams, 1997; Tommasi et a/., 2015).

Second Law: The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of the genes. Third Law: A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families. Dr. Turkheimer discusses the implications of these laws in the context of new challenges for explaining how genetic and environmental influences may work. Recently, Plomin and Deary (2015) offered their own version of three laws: all traits show significant genetic influence; no traits are 100% heritable; heritability is caused by many genes of small effect. This chapter is not the place to discuss these laws in detail. I cite them here to emphasize the sea change in thinking about the role genes play in complex traits, virtually all of which have high heritability estimates according to a comprehensive meta-analysis that included almost every twin and adoption study ever conducted (Polderman et a/., 2015). High heritability is a primary reason that neuroscience research on intelligence is expanding so quickly.",

Here is an interesting example of progress in testing hypotheses about not just whether genes are involved in intelligence, but how genes are involved. An important question is whether the genetic basis of high intelligence and any influence of environmental factors on the salient genes are the same for the average and lower parts of the normal distribution of intelligence test scores. High intelligence might result from different genetic and environmental factors than those that influence average and lower intelligence. The latter view is called the discontinuity hypothesis. One discontinuity hypothesis is central to the view that expertise associated with high intelligence is more a reflection of practice and motivation effects stemming from experiences rather than from inherited ability. Another discontinuity hypothesis is that different genes are involved in high intelligence than the",

Of the 14,238 children born in 1963 and living in Warsaw, 96 percent were given the Ravens Progressive Matrices Test and an arithmetic and a vocabulary test in March to June of 1974. Information was collected on the families of the children, and on characteristics of schools and city districts. Parental occupation and education were used to form a family factor, and the district data were collapsed into two factors, one relating to social marginality, and the other to distance from city center. Analysis showed that the initial assumption of even distribution of family, school, and district attributes was reasonable. Mental performance was unrelated either to school or district factors. It was related to parental occupation and education in a strong and regular gradient. It is concluded that an egalitarian social policy executed over a generation failed to override the association of social and family factors with cognitive development that is characteristic of more traditional industrial societies. In the context of this chapter, the confounding of genetic and SES factors leads to a possible alternative conclusion: Any influence of social policy on mental performance failed to override the influence of genetic factors. The same confounding is apparent in new studies which suggest that SES accounts for brain differences",

For decades, breeding experiments in mice had produced tantalizing evidence that learning how to navigate a maze to find cheese had a genetic basis. Some mice learned faster than others, and when the smart mice were bred with other smart mice, the offspring learned the maze faster. In 1999, genetic engineering was used for the first time to create smart mice that could learn a maze more quickly (Tang et al., 1999). The researchers named the strain of these mice Doogie, after a TV character that was a precocious teenager in medical school. This achievement (the mice, not the TV show) was based on considerable previous animal work that showed a certain synaptic receptor, NMDA (A-methyl pb-aspartate), was involved in learning and memory. A single gene (NR2B) was found to regulate a part of this receptors function. The researchers spliced this gene into the DNA of ordinary mice embryos. The resulting Doogie strain of mice learned a series of tasks faster than controls.",

Using discordant identical twins (reared together), even a small sample, minimized irrelevant genetic and environmental factors and maximized the chances of finding salient differences in gene expression related to intelligence even if differences might be the result of epigenetic influences. The use of multiple methods of DNA analysis allowed for independent replications within the same sample. The outcome identified several possible differences in gene expression that suggest brain mechanisms that might be related to intelligence. The findings illustrate the complexity of gene expression and regulation that are far beyond our discussion here, but they demonstrate that finding genes is only the first step toward understanding exactly what the genes do and how they influence or regulate neurobiology and brain function on the molecular level.",

None of the 12 candidate genes was associated with intelligence in a robust statistical manner. This failure to replicate intelligence genes, ina large sample with sufficient statistical power to find small effects if effects existed, was offset by successful replication in the same sample for control candidate genes related to Alzheimers disease and to body mass. The authors did not express discouragement at their failure to replicate genes for intelligence and concluded that even larger samples might be needed to find and replicate multiple genes if each one accounted for even tinier amounts of intelligence variance.

Genomics is the term used to describe mapping genomes using many different methods. Every person has a unique genome, although most of the gene sequence is the same for everyone. Chromosomes are made of two strands of DNA molecules, the so-called double helix. During reproduction, the offspring randomly inherits these strands from each parent. The strands all are constructed from a combination of only four base molecules, (A)denine, (G)uanine, (C)ytosine, (T)hymine. These four arrange themselves in pairs across the two strands of DNA in the double helix like rungs on a ladder. Each member of a pair is inherited from one parent. On each rung, A and T, and G and C form pairs.",

Genes create amino acids that form thousands of different proteins, and proteins are the building blocks of life that determine how an organism develops and functions at the cellular level. The sequence from amino acid creation to protein formation is called gene expression. RNA is similar to DNA, but RNA essentially translates the DNA code into amino acids and proteins.

There are often repeat copies of a gene at a locus and the number of copies sometimes can be related to normal or abnormal protein functions. DNA analysis generally breaks strands into fragments using any of several techniques. One technical breakthrough allowed the identification of small variations in the DNA sequence at any point on a strand where a base pair is changed or mutated. These errors are called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For example, if a sequence at a locus typically is GTCGAATTGGAATTGG, sometimes the first T can be a C in some individuals. This variation in the general sequence is a SNP. Most SNPs are non-functional, but some are related to diseases and possibly to traits like intelligence. One estimate is that there are about 30 million SNPs in a persons DNA. SNPs can be compared between two groups, say defined by high or low IO scores, in an effort to find segments of DNA, perhaps individual genes, that differentiate the groups. Early studies sampled thousands of SNPs. Now an entire",

Although not every person completed the same tests, g-scores from different batteries are highly correlated (even over.95) if the test batteries and the sample are sufficiently diverse (Johnson et al., 2008b). Several advanced statistical analyses revealed four promising genes of interest related to very small amounts of variance in cognitive performance. Interestingly, these genes (KNCMAI, NRXNI, POU2F3, SCRT; 1 am not responsible for how genes are named) are known to influence a glutamate neurotransmitter pathway related to brain plasticity and learning and memory. The pathway involves the NMDA receptor, glutamate binding, and synaptic changes.

They started with a specific hypothesis that focused on genes related to post- synaptic functioning. After replication in independent samples, proteins related to the NMDA receptor were associated specifically with fluid intelligence. Other aspects of post-synaptic functioning were not related to variation in any other cognitive abilities. NMDA was also implicated indirectly in the study of Rietveld et al., but these post- synaptic findings tied genetic variation of specific proteins to individual differences in fluid intelligence. The key protein was guanylate kinase (MAGUK), fundamentally important for converting neuronal action potentials into biological signals that underlie information processing throughout the brain. This study provides additional hints about the neurobiology of intelligence.",

BDNF is related to cognitive functioning in healthy people, especially to aspects of memory and to impaired cognition in Alzheimers disease and other brain disorders. Val66Met, a gene associated with BDNF, also is implicated in neural repair mechanisms that stimulate neuro-regeneration in the prefrontal cortex after recovery from TBI. Is BDNF related to intelligence? After TBI to the frontal lobes, some patients show persistent deficits in g-loaded tasks, whereas in other patients there is a preservation of g-loaded task performance. The genetic basis for BDNF is the Val66Met polymorphism (see Textbox 2.2) that has two main variations, Val/Met and Val/Val.

These results may have implications for cognitive rehabilitation strategies that might be more effective than others, although there is a paucity of such research at present. The results also tie variations in the BDNF gene to intelligence and demonstrate some progress toward identifying specific gene variants related to intelligence. Such data can help generate hypotheses about the step- by-step cascade of neurochemical events at the molecular level that lead from the genetics of BDNF expression to explaining a small amount of variance among individuals in intelligence. It is likely that there are many steps in the cascade and multiple complex interactions with other genetic or biological factors, some of which might occur in an epigenetic context. And BDNF is only one of many factors probably involved.",

These researchers also focused on one molecular factor, a protein called DUF1220 that is associated with brain size and brain evolution. DUF1220 has two main subtypes, CON1 and CON2. Many gene sequences have multiple copies in a persons DNA and the number of copies can be related to diseases and other traits. In this study, not only was the number of copies of CON2 associated with IQ scores, the association was linear. That is, the more copies of CON2, the higher the IQ score. Brain size, assessed by MRI, also was correlated to IQ score, especially for the surface area of the temporal cortex bilaterally, and right frontal surface area was related to increased dosage of CON1 and CON2. These findings came froma sample of 600 North American young people and were replicated in a smaller sample of 75 individuals living in New Zealand. Although both samples are quite small compared to the previous studies just summarized, the linear nature of the CON2 copy/IQ finding is intriguing, especially because it was strongest in males 6-11 years old. There are a number of reasons to be cautious about this finding, as acknowledged by the authors, and it is too early to accept it at face value. Nonetheless, it represents another example of how the search for intelligence genes is pushed forward with a priori hypotheses about specific genetic factors.",

They reported a meta-analysis based on a GWAS of middle-aged and older adults who had completed a battery of four cognitive tests (Davies et al., 2015). This is the largest such study of general cognitive ability to date. Across all the samples, 13 SNPs were associated with general cognitive ability, together accounting for 29% and 28% of the variance in two of the largest samples, respectively. Three genomic regions were associated with these SNPs with special focus on the HMGNI region. Four genes previously associated with Alzheimers disease also were associated with general cognitive ability (TOMM40, APOE, ABCG1, MEF2C). Consistent with the polygenetic model of inheritance, these genes individually accounted for small proportions of variance. These researchers also conclude that even larger samples will be required to identify more genome-wide associations. No one yet knows how many genes may contribute to variations in intelligence, but the very existence of these multicenter collaborations is a giant step toward finding out. In fact, just after this book went into production, an elaborate collaborative study identified two networks of genes (1,148 genes in one network and 150 genes in the other) that were related to general cognition (Johnson et al., 2016). Many of these genes were related to specific synaptic functions that potentially could be manipulated to influence intelligence. I do not have space to elaborate more details of this landmark study, but the hunt for intelligence genes has taken another major step forward.",

Whereas Chabris and colleagues had started with 12 candidate genes from previous studies and failed to replicate any of them, these researchers selected 158 genes that had been associated with IQ scores. They mapped the locations of these genes on chromosomes and found some clustering in seven regions of chromosome 7 and the X-chromosome. Many of these genes were known to be involved in various neural mechanisms and pathways. Using a type of network analysis, IQ-related pathways were constructed. These pathways primarily involved dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters involved in many brain functions. The details of this analysis are far beyond our intentions in this chapter, but this report illustrates how molecular genetics can generate testable hypotheses about specific neural mechanisms related to intelligence, and how those mechanisms might be tweaked by drugs or other means. Work like this fuels my optimism that the genetic basis for intelligence is not a retreat to determinism and immutability. Rather the opposite: the genetic basis, once understood, can lead to the remarkable ability to treat or prevent brain disorders that result in low IQ and to the Holy Grail of increasing intelligence across the whole range, as we will discuss in Chapter 5.",

This chapter is written to give a somewhat personal historical perspective on the early studies from 1988 to 2006, a period I describe as phase one in the application of modern brain-imaging technology to intelligence research. This phase began with the first positron emission tomography (PET) study of intelligence, published in 1988, and ends with a review of the relevant literature published in 2007. The 37 studies during this period reported several unexpected results and set the direction for current imaging/intelligence research. This chapter is written in roughly chronological order of publication to demonstrate how the early research unfolded, including my research. This perspective helps students understand how researchers advance from one set of findings to new questions. There are also basic descriptions of how the main imaging technologies work. In the next Chapter (4), we Il see the subsequent and more sophisticated phase two of worldwide brain-imaging research on intelligence. Brain-imaging technology has significantly helped advance intelligence research from mainly psychometric methods (described in Chapter |) to neuroscience approaches that can quantify brain characteristics. Brain imaging is a key development in this field and that is why we devote two chapters to it.",

Prior to the introduction of neuroimaging in the early 1980s, brain researchers were limited to indirect measurements of brain chemistry by-products found in blood, urine, and spinal fluid. EEG and evoked potential (EP) research allowed millisecond-by-millisecond measurements of brain activity, but technical issues like distortion of electrical signals by the scalp and poor spatial resolution limited the scope and interpretation of data. Today, EEG-based techniques are more sophisticated and include ways to map cortical activity (see Chapter 4). Inferences from studies of patients with brain damage and from autopsy studies similarly had only limited success in identifying brain/intelligence relationships. For example, some studies of patients with brain damage concluded that the frontal lobes",

Somewhere on the straight line connecting these two simultaneous events, a positron decayed. With millions of these coincident detections, the spatial location of the accumulated positrons can be determined and the areas releasing the most gamma rays can be quantified. These are the areas most active during the FDG uptake and the activation patterns in areas will be different depending on the mental activity during the uptake. It takes about 32 minutes for the brain to take up the FDG tracer. This means that brain activity is summed over the 32 minutes so the time resolution of FDG PET scans is very long. You cannot see how brain activity changes from second to second. However, radioactive oxygen instead of glucose can be used in PET to image blood flow with a time resolution of minutes. Other imaging techniques based on MRI have time resolutions of about 1-2 seconds and newer methods like the magneto-encephalogram (MEG) show changes millisecond by millisecond. Compared to PET, MRI and MEG techniques also are far less intrusive (no injections or exposure to radioactivity), as we will detail in due course as they have been applied to intelligence research.",

Back in 1988 we started thinking about how learning, a key component of intelligence, might make the brain more efficient. When you learn something like driving a car, for example, doesnt your brain get more efficient so you now can drive in traffic and have a conversation at the same time, something not possible that very first day you were concentrating on driving back and forth in a big empty parking lot?",

The object is to place each shape so they form perfect rows with no gaps at the bottom of the screen. When you complete a row, it disappears and all the shapes above drop down, changing the configuration as the shapes continue to drop. The main object is to complete as many rows as possible before the shapes not in complete rows stack up to the top of the play space, which ends the game. The better you do (the more rows you complete), the faster the shapes drop, so with practice, the game is faster and harder.",

So, I decided to shift emphasis a bit and I was able to get a grant to study Downs syndrome, a genetic disorder typically associated with low IQ. These individuals would be of inherent interest and so would the requisite normal control group. Federal agencies are more inclined to fund research on disease and syndrome categories (and stupidity is not yet a category recognized by the National Institutes of Health, so there is no national institute to study it), especially if the grant application barely mentions IQ. By the way, this is still largely the case, although there is an emerging exception for projects that propose to increase IQ in disadvantaged children by means of cognitive training. We will discuss this more in Chapter 5.",

The early talent searchers found many more young boys than girls with high SAT-Math scores. In 1995 I decided to use PET to see if men and women showed equal brain efficiency in the same brain areas while they solved mathematical reasoning problems. Mathematical reasoning is a more specific mental ability than the g-factor, so this would expand the bounds of the efficiency hypothesis.

Remember, in this study the men and women were equally matched on SAT-Math score, and they solved the same problems during the scan equally well. Their brains, however, showed apparently different patterns of activity. To us, this meant that not all brains work the same. This may seem obvious and even trite to you, but most cognitive researchers are interested in discovering how brains work in general, assuming that all brains basically work the same way. A focus on individual differences and the idea that not all brains work the same way was not so popular then or now. Also, remember, mathematical reasoning ability is a more specific factor; its not g. Brain efficiency may be related to g, but for specific abilities like mathematical reasoning, better performance may require more brain activity. Along these lines, another PET study about the same time in eight middle-aged individuals reported increased activation during the performance of a perceptual maze task, a measure of visuospatial reasoning, which also is a more specific factor of intelligence than g (Ghatan et al., 1995).",

This was a project on emotional memory so some videos were more emotionally loaded than others, but as a separate analysis, we looked at whether intelligence, assessed by the g-loaded RAPM test of abstract reasoning, was related to watching the videos irrespective of their emotional content. We correlated brain activity during this non-problem-solving condition to RAPM scores. Significant correlations were apparent in several areas. None were in the frontal lobes. Most were in the posterior areas of the brain where basic information is perceived before it is processed by association areas more toward the front of the brain. This suggested that people with higher RAPM scores seemed to be viewing videos with different brain activity than lower RAPM people. We think this means that smarter people are more engaged and actively processing the video information differently. In other words, the smarter brains were not so passive. This is more evidence that not all brains work the same way, perhaps even while watching television.",

In 2000, however, one group of researchers claimed their PET study showed that the neural basis of the g-factor was derived from a specific lateral frontal lobe system and downplayed the importance of other regions (Duncan et al., 2000). They imaged blood flow over a 2-minute period as 13 subjects (with the wide age range of 21-34) performed a small number of problems that varied in g-loadings. Blood flow increased during the tasks, but only the frontal activations were noted as common to the high and middle g-loaded tasks.

Also, they were apparently recruited at a distinguished university, so a severe restriction of range of g-scores is likely, limiting correlations. Imaging occurred during a few problems while subjects worked at their own pace so the task reliability was low and averaging over subjects could minimize any differences due to differences in speed of responding to the problems. As for interpretation, none of the previous PET studies showing distributed areas related to high g-scores were cited, so there was no acknowledgment or discussion of inverse correlations or a distributed network of areas other than in the frontal lobe. And their own data for the high-g task showed activation in multiple areas outside the frontal lobes. Subsequently, Dr. John Duncan, the research leader, apparently abandoned the frontal lobe-centered model of intelligence and came to the view that other areas also were involved (Bishop et al., 2008; Duncan, 2010), consistent with virtually all other studies available at that time (Jung & Haier, 2007). So we will not dwell on this short-lived detour other than to note that its publication in Science brought important attention to imaging/intelligence research and validated again that g-scores could be studied scientifically, a proposition that had been surprisingly controversial. So even this flawed paper had some positive effect. At the time, journals",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not require radioactive injections so no cyclotron or hot lab is required, making MRI scans considerably less expensive than PET (about $500-$800 versus $2,500). MRI is based on the effect of magnetic fields on spinning protons and hydrogen molecules. Because it produces high- resolution images of the entire body that have many important clinical uses without radiation exposure, MRI quickly became a must-have technology for most hospitals, especially ones associated with universities. This allowed many cognitive psychologists access and, in fact, within a dozen years or so, most psychology departments at major universities had their own MRI scanner, a multimillion dollar expense once unthinkable for a psychology department (although acquisition of imaging equipment by psychology departments was predicted by at least one prescient researcher; Haier, 1990).

Very rapid sequential images can show regional blood flow as a function of hemoglobin determinations and blood flow is an indirect measure of neuron activity. The more a brain area is active, the more blood flows to it. It is functional MRI (fMRI) that has been used widely in cognitive neuroscience to show brain activity during specific cognitive tasks.",

Software for the application of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) became available in about 1999 (statistical parametric mapping, SPM) and the field moved dramatically away from customized image analysis based on ROIs that differed in their boundaries among research groups to a more standardized approach. Typically, the results of voxel-based analyses were reported as spatial locations in the brain using a standard set of coordinates developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI coordinates) and the locations were described additionally using a standard nomenclature based on Brodmann areas (BAs) derived from early autopsy descriptions of different cellular organization among cortical regions (Brodmann, 1909), Textbox 3.1 describes the VBM method and includes an illustration of BAs. SPM is updated periodically with improvements and additional",

Finally, values are calculated that reflect the amount of gray or white matter tissue in each voxel in the whole brain.

Cortical thickness (CT) was correlated with IQ, but there was a clear developmental sequence showing a dynamic relationship between regional CT and intelligence as the brain matures through childhood and adolescence. The strongest correlations between IQ and CT were found in late childhood (approximately 8-12 years). These correlations were positive and they were found in areas throughout the brain. However, there was a difference between high- and average-IQ individuals. The high-IQ subjects showed an initial accelerated and prolonged phase of cortical increase, which yields to equally vigorous cortical thinning by early adolescence.

By design, this eliminates individual differences in task performance.

With the exception of Aljoscha Neubauer, it was the first time I met these researchers in person. Rex Jungs presentation was a compelling review of several studies that emphasized the distributed nature of brain areas associated with intelligence. Based on his clinical background as a neuropsychologist and his MRS research on white matter and IQ, he also emphasized the importance of white matter connections among the salient brain areas. It was apparent that he and I had similar interests so we undertook a comprehensive review of the entire brain imaging/intelligence literature. It took us over two years to write the review, which was published in 2007 along with commentaries from other researchers (Haier & Jung, 2007; Jung & Haier, 2007).",

Given the wide disparity of methods and measures, and the number of potential brain areas involved, a typical meta-analysis was not appropriate. Instead, we followed a method used to review the emerging literature from cognitive neuroimaging studies (Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000). We reviewed structural MRI results, PET results, and fMRI results. We focused on findings common among studies irrespective of different imaging and assessment methods. Several brain areas were common in 50% or more of the 37 studies. This may seem a rather weak proportion, but it is similar to the proportions",

They come from the most recent neuroimaging studies, including those obtained in conjunction with genetic methods. We include studies of adults and children, patients with brain damage, and introduce more advanced methods of brain image acquisition and analysis. These studies continue to intrigue and motivate researchers worldwide to push assessment technologies to even greater precision, increase the sample sizes to levels previously unimaginable, and offer new, testable hypotheses about intelligence and the brain. One word of caution: most of the studies in the last chapter and many in this chapter have sample sizes that are too small for conclusive interpretations. Remember our second law no one study is definitive. As this field continues to mature, sample sizes are increasing rather dramatically. Over time, the weight of evidence always favors studies with sufficient sample sizes that maximize the stability of findings and minimize unreliable ones. This is especially so for the early studies seeking to identify candidate genes related to intelligence. I am including such studies for historical context and for illustrating how the weight of evidence evolves.",

Methods of neuroimaging and analysis were limited with respect to their ability to assess structural or functional brain network connections and how well information was processed in networks during problem-solving. This state of affairs improved quickly and dramatically for intelligence research with the application of new mathematical/statistical ways to assess connectivity among brain areas, new image-analysis techniques to assess the integrity of white matter transmission of information, and the use of the magneto- encephalogram (MEG) technology to assess regions of neuron activity dynamically every millisecond during the performance of a cognitive task. Adding to the increased pace of intelligence research, neuroimaging is now combined with genetic methods in several large-scale consortia. These advances are the focus of this chapter. There are at least 50 recent neuroimaging studies to choose from that illustrate the momentum of these advances in intelligence research. We cannot summarize them all, but lets start with some key studies of brain network connectivity and what they found. These studies are presented in mostly chronological order so that the story is told as it has unfolded. All the studies reported in this chapter implicate many brain areas. I decided to include the major ones for completeness. You will get a sufficient feel for the general findings without memorizing these areas. It may be helpful to refer to the brain area maps in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 from the last chapter as you read this chapter.",

In fMRI, the value is based on blood flow. To determine how one brain area may be related to all other brain areas, correlations can be computed between any individual voxel, or group of voxels, defining a region of interest (ROI) and all other voxels (or ROIs) throughout the entire brain. The starting voxel is called the seed. Multiple seeds can be placed wherever the researchers wish depending on the hypothesis to be tested. The pattern of correlations indicates how the seed areas are connected to other brain areas. The connections are statistical and may or may not reflect actual anatomical connections.",

Networks in the brain tend to be small-world connections in that most clustering of connectivity is around adjacent brain areas or neighborhoods. There are also connections among more distant regions in the brain through hubs that are connected to each other; these are the so-called rich clubs (van den Heuvel ef al., 2012). Small-world networks tend to allow more efficient transmission of information across shorter distances with less wiring (white matter fibers) and rich clubs foster faster communication across more distant brain areas. These networks develop at different times and rates from infancy through early adulthood. The factors that influence how networks develop are not yet understood, but they likely are related to individual differences in cognitive abilities. Graph analysis is illustrated in Textbox 4.1.",

Higher IQ was correlated to brain areas that show weaker inter-hemispheric homotopic connectivity, suggesting that decreased inter-hemisphere communication is related to higher intelligence. Several of the homotopic areas are included in the PFIT, but this study adds a new dimension of inter- hemisphere communication. Age and sex differences were also reported. For example, higher-IQ females showed less homotopic connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and posterior midline regions. Younger participants (below age 25) with higher IQs also showed increased homotopic connectivity patterns. These age and sex analyses were done on smaller subsamples so must be viewed with caution, but they illustrate the potential importance of using these variables as a matter of routine. Because the results are based on resting-state data, one wonders whether functional homotopic relationships with IQ might be even stronger if based on fMRI during a cognitive task. Wonder no longer. In a 2014 study of 79 participants, networks were identified from both resting-state fMRI and fMRI during problem-solving of items from the Ravens test (Vakhtin et a/., 2014). This is the only imaging study of intelligence to date that investigated both resting-state and task activation conditions in the same subjects. Connectivity was determined with a statistical technique called independent component analysis prior to the homotopic analysis reported subsequently (Santarnecchi et al., 2015b). Functional connectivity during the problem- solving overlapped with functional connectivity during the resting state. The overlapping networks were consistent with the PFIT.",

Remember our first law: nothing about the brain is simple. In my view, there is no need for you to memorize all the things any brain area does. Think just about the fact that we are at the point where we can identify a set of brain areas related to intelligence. We are identifying the individual instruments in the orchestra. Learning how they work together to create the symphony of intelligence is a new challenge that requires even better technology and we will discuss one, the magneto-encephalogram (MEG), in Section 4.2.

In that report, the concept of efficiency was general and included possible characteristics of brain networks, neurons (especially mitochondria), and/or synaptic events. We also speculated that the decreased cortical activation we observed following task practice might result from the brain learning which areas not to use while task-relevant areas worked harder (Haier et al., 1992b). From this rather inexact beginning, it is not surprising that demonstrating a relationship between brain efficiency and intelligence has produced inconsistent results over the years. A subsequent review of the research literature concluded that brain efficiency was moderated primarily by type of task and by sex (Neubauer & Fink, 2009). Up to that time, most brain efficiency studies were based on EEG methods. The graph analyses summarized in the last section provided indirect evidence that structural and functional brain network efficiency was related to intelligence, but the story became more complex as more",

Generally, the sequence starts in posterior sensory processing areas, travels forward to parietal and temporal association areas where information is integrated, and then moves on to frontal lobe areas for hypothesis testing and decision-making. How often this sequence might be repeated while solving a particular problem could be a key variable related to individual differences in intelligence. The exact areas involved in the sequence could also differ among individuals and so could the timing of the sequence. MEG provides a means to assess the actual sequence and compare it to what the PFIT predicts. For example, individuals with high intelligence test scores might engage a different set of PFIT areas than individuals with average intelligence test scores. Perhaps fewer areas would define a sequence in the high-score group, consistent with efficiency. Or, individuals may engage the same set of PFIT areas in the same sequence irrespective of intelligence, with high intelligence related to a faster speed of engaging or repeating the sequence of areas. We are investigating these hypotheses using MEG in a sample of 32 young adults. Each participant performs four different cognitive tasks adapted for computer administration in",

As discussed in Chapter 1, SAT scores are a good estimate of general intelligence and that is an important reason they are good predictors of academic success. Can a better estimate of intelligence or predictor of academic success be extracted from a brain image? This is an empirical question, and a positive answer is probably far less scary than you might think. In fact, brain images are likely to be more objective, especially structural images, and not sensitive to a host of factors that potentially can influence psychometric test scores, like motivation or anxiety. Whether you are a good test-taker or not is irrelevant for getting a scan. Brain images generally are less expensive than SAT preparation courses or formal IQ testing and getting a brain image is far less time-consuming. There is no preparation, you spend about 20 minutes in the scanner, and you can have a nap during structural image acquisition. Still not interested in this possibility?",

This claim was derived from their research correlating IQ to N-aspartate in a single brain area (see Chapter 3) (Jung et al., 1999a, 1999b). In 2006, a group from South Korea filed a patent application to measure IQ froma combination of structural and functional MRI assessments and that patent eventually was issued in 2012 (US 8,301,223 B2).

Presumably, different cognitive domains require different brain networks so various brain measures for different domains might be combined to predict IQ.

This method and related versions of it use the correlation between IQ and each measure after removing common relationships between measures. For example, if variable Acorrelates to IQ and so do variables B and C, they cannot be simply combined without first statistically removing the common variance between A and B, A and C, and B and C. The remaining correlations to IQ for each variable are called partial correlations. Regression equations combine partial correlations between each variable and IQ along with computing weights for each variable that maximize the IQ prediction. In the ABC example, A might be weighted more than B and B might be weighted more than C in order to make the strongest IQ prediction. The resulting equation can then be applied to a new persons data and an IQ score predicted. The correlation between a predicted IQ score and the actual IQ score for a large group of individuals must be nearly perfect for the equation to be acceptable as a substitute for an actual IQ score. It is not sufficient if an equation produces a statistically significant correlation between the predicted IQ and the actual IQ. Whenever a regression equation is calculated in a research sample, the exact same equation must be applied to an independent sample so the predicted and actual IQ score correlation can be replicated. This is cross-validation of the equation and this step is required because the original equation may produce a spuriously high correlation by incorporating chance effects, especially in small samples. In our research, we have tried the regression approach on several occasions, but each regression equation failed on cross-validation so neither publication nor patent was attempted.",

Virtually all brain image analysis starts with morphing each brain into a standard size and shape, called a template. This step artificially reduces individual differences in brain anatomy by creating an average brain. To account for the imprecision of average brain anatomy, analyses typically add a step of smoothing in an effort to minimize the imprecision. Nonetheless, forcing all brains into a standard space introduces error into efforts to predict IQ from images. Some template methods create more error than others. Consider a neuroimaging study of male/female differences. Should the males be standardized to a male template and the females to a female template, or should everyone be standardized to the same template? Many neuroimaging studies use a standard template supplied by the analysis software and other studies create a template from only the participants in the study. No one way is always correct, but the issue presents a problem for efforts to predict IQ. A study of 100 postmortem brains highlights the issue (Witelson et al., 2006). Their strongest finding was that 36% of differences in verbal ability scores was predicted by cerebral volume. However, age, sex, and handedness influenced regression analyses between other anatomical features and different cognitive abilities in complex ways. The authors cautioned neuroimaging researchers to take these factors into account.",

This is common in personality testing where a profile of scores on different personality scales is used to characterize an individual. Profiles are used extensively to interpret personality tests like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), for example. MMPI scores from the different subscales can be used in regression analyses, but the analysis of individual profiles allows comparisons of groups of people defined by similar profiles across the subscales to determine variables related to the profile type. We illustrated this approach for predicting intelligence by creating profiles of individuals based on the amount of gray matter in several PFIT areas and tried to relate the profile to IQ score (Haier, 2009b). As shown in Figure 4.10, this demonstration did not work so well. The two individuals shown with equally high IQ scores had different gray matter profiles. Nonetheless, we are now trying this profile approach with the MEG data as shown in Textbox 4.2. It is a promising approach for future study in large samples. In fact, an encouraging report used patterns of {MRI activation (including in some PFIT areas) to predict profiles of cognitive performance, while a small sample of 26 participants solved deductive reasoning problems (Reverberi ef al., 2012). The analyses show the complexity of the problem, but the results illustrate my optimism that individual differences",

We do not know if twice the amount of gray matter in a particular part of the cortex, for example, makes one twice as smart. We are now able to explore redefining intelligence in ways that incorporate neurometric assessments.

There is a specialization within the field of cognitive psychology that studies reasoning. Relational reasoning, inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, analogical reasoning, and other kinds of reasoning are subjects in a variety of studies, including ones that use neuroimaging to identify brain characteristics and networks related to reasoning. The anomaly is that more than a few of these cognitive neuroscience studies of reasoning do not use the word intelligence and they often fail to cite relevant neuroimaging studies of intelligence. This is problematic because tests of reasoning are highly correlated to the g-factor (Jensen, 1998). In fact, analogy tests have some of the highest g-loadings of any mental ability tests. Obviously, this means that findings from intelligence studies are quite relevant to reasoning research and vice versa.",

One novel finding concerned the subcortical parahippocampus, unusual because most studies have focused on the cortex.

Summarizing results in this chapter from the combination of the neuroimaging and the quantitative genetic domains without oversimplifying is a challenge, but at minimum, the progress and excitement in the field should be clear to all readers. We are light years past earlier controversies about whether there is a role for genetics for understanding individual differences in intelligence. The challenge in the next section is explaining the complexity of neuroimaging analysis combined with the even greater complexity of molecular genetic analysis. The details may be difficult and the gene nomenclature of letter/number combinations seems irrational. But heres the main point.

They focused their imaging efforts in a novel way to help identify specific genes related to brain connectivity and intelligence. As we noted earlier in this chapter, in 2009 they had reported that there were genes in common for the integrity of white matter tracts and intelligence based on cross- trait maps of the respective heritability of each. They expanded this approach using DTI and DNA data from a sample of 472 twins and their non-twin siblings. The basic idea was to use statistical methods of clustering many variables based on their similarity. First, thousands of points within white matter fibers were clustered to find brain systems with common genetic determination. The white matter measure was FA, as described previously. Then they used DNA in a genome-wide scan and network analyses to identify a network of genes that was related to white matter integrity in major tracts. FA in some hubs in the white matter network was related to IQ scores (their figure 9). The results of this analysis are complex and include 14 specific genes listed in their table 5, along with what was known about each ones function in 2012. We include their table here (Table 4.1) to illustrate how intelligence potentially can be tied to brain function on the molecular level, although none of the entries in the table have been replicated. This kind of study illustrates both the complexity of understanding how genes function and a major neuroscience direction for future intelligence research. There is a long road between observations like these and making any practical use of them. However, if replicated, identifying genes related to intelligence and how they function can point to potential mechanisms for enhancing intellectual performance if the cascade of genetic influences on functional molecular events can be manipulated at the right stage of brain development. This includes manipulating more general genetic effects on brain structures like white matter integrity that",

One of the largest is named ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis). One of their papers included a finding that related individual differences in intelligence to a specific variant in a gene called HMGA2 that is related to brain size (Stein et al., 2012). Their discovery and replication samples included thousands of participants who had completed neuroimaging in addition to cognitive and DNA testing. As in other studies, the finding explained only a tiny fraction of variance in intelligence, but it illustrates a definitive victory for finding a gene needle in a haystack of DNA.",

This IMAGEN report started by examining the relationship between CT and nearly 55,000 SNPs. One variant (rs7171755) was associated with thinner cortex in the left frontal and temporal lobes, and in a small subsample, with WAIS scores.

Recall our three laws once again: no story about the brain is simple; no one study is definitive; and it takes many years to sort out conflicting and inconsistent findings and establish a weight of evidence.

To repeat, IQ points are not measures like inches or pounds. This key problem, at the heart of claims about increasing intelligence, is all but ignored in the studies we will review in this chapter. In Chapter 2 we reviewed the failures of earnest compensatory and early childhood education programs to boost IQ. These programs have other positive results, but the weight of evidence does not support any claims concerning increased intelligence as assessed with IQ or other psychometric tests. One hypothesis is that this failure may be due in large part to the genetic influences on intelligence demonstrated in the many studies we have discussed in Chapters 2 and 4. Nonetheless, apparently undaunted by past failures and inherent measurement problems, or ignorant of them, there are newer reports in the scientific literature that claim to raise IQ scores dramatically in children and adults. We will examine three of these specific claims under the implied heading, Dont let this happen to you. These claims are based on the use of classical music, memory training, and computer games to raise IQ. By showing how such claims should be evaluated skeptically I hope to inoculate you against future declarations of alleged breakthrough or landmark results. Following these cautionary case studies, we then examine equally dubious claims about drugs that increase IQ. After that, we move on to the exciting possibility of increasing intelligence by neuroscience means that test the boundary between science and",

The letter claimed that listening to a particular Mozart sonata for 10 minutes temporarily increased IQ by 8 points (Rauscher et a/., 1993). Eight points is about half a standard deviation, quite a large effect for a mere 10-minute intervention. Intelligence researchers recognized immediately that this sounded too good to be true. It was not true but, amazingly, it took six years to dampen popular enthusiasm after a critical review (Chabris, 1999). Another 11 years were needed to finally put this claim to rest with the publication of a comprehensive review article titled, Mozart effect Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis (Pietschnig et al., 2010). The title speaks for itself. Over the 17 years this popular myth endured, an uncountable number of Mozart and other classical music CDs were purchased with the expectation of increasing IQ by just listening. School music programs gained new support and music lessons gained a new rationale. Enumerable high school science fair projects investigated various aspects of the Mozart Effect, tested mostly on friends and family. In fairness, these were hardly terrible consequences of a wrong idea. Possibly with the exception of a few accordion lessons, no one was harmed, but no ones IQ increased either.",

After each condition, one of the three tests was given. For the Mozart condition, the standard test score was 57.56. This was statistically higher than 54.61 for the relaxation condition and 54.00 for the silence condition. These standard test scores were translated to spatial IQ scores of 119, 111, and 110, respectively. These findings are shown in Figure 5.1.

In addition to the media coverage, some intelligence researchers at the time seized on any findings that suggested IQ was highly malleable as evidence against a strong role for genetic influences on intelligence. The Nature report also spoke to a desire for an easy way to acquire greater intelligence at a relatively small cost and no risk. According to an article in the New York Times (January 15, 1998), Governor Zell Miller of Georgia proposed spending $105,000 a year from the state budget to purchase classical music tapes or CDs for the approximately 100,000 children born in Georgia each year (iPods were not yet a reality). During his budget address to lawmakers, the Governor played part of Beethovens Ode to Joy and asked, Now dont you feel smarter already? He also remarked that from his experience growing up, Musicians were folks that not only could play a fiddle but they also were good mechanics. The article also quoted a skeptic: Im familiar with those findings and, at the moment, said Sandra Trehaub, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto who studies infants perception of music, I dont think we have the evidence to make that statement unambiguously. If we really think you can swallow a pill, buy a record or a particular book or have any one experience and that thats going to be the thing that gets you into Harvard or Princeton, then thats an illusion.

Chabris concluded that these small effects were likely due to the effect of positive mood invoked by an enjoyable experience like listening to Mozart. In his formulation, enjoyable experience increases arousal, especially in the right hemisphere, which processes spatialtemporal information. A second letter in this citation from Dr. Kenneth Steele and colleagues reported a complete failure to replicate the findings from the original 1993 experiment. Some of their results indicated poorer test performance after listening to Mozart. In response, Dr. Rauscher noted that the original report did not claim an increase in intelligence. She contended that the claim was limited to spatial-temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering. She pointed out that the smaller number of studies in Chabris meta-analysis that used only tests of spatial-temporal reasoning did show an increase after Mozart listening, and she critiqued his enjoyment arousal hypothesis. She also critiqued the studies from the Steele group because they were not exact replications. She acknowledged that there were inconsistent results from independent studies and concluded, Because some people cannot get bread to rise does not negate the existence of a yeast effect.",

My copy of that release (embargoed until 6 PM EDT, October 13, 1993) begins with the finding about spatial intelligence, but then quotes the researchers as saying, Thus, the IQs of subjects participating in the music condition were 8-9 points above their scores in the other two conditions. The distinction between spatial and general intelligence could have been clearer. After the 1999 exchange in Nature, controversy about a Mozart Effect on any mental ability tests persisted.

The original study had been conducted at my university under the auspices of the prestigious Center for Learning and Memory, and I knew the senior author, Dr. Gordon Shaw. Although I was unaware of the study before it was published, I subsequently had a number of affable conversations with him. A physicist by training, he was interested in the brain and problem-solving and, before he passed away, he was developing a theory relating the complexity of music composition to cognition. He regretted the widespread misunderstandings about the original finding and general intelligence, but he remained convinced that music and cognition were linked in a positive way. Considerable research supports this view and his work with Dr. Rauscher helped stimulate interest in this important area. Whatever the many rich benefits of music exposure and training are, increased intelligence, general or spatial, is not one of them. The Mozart Effect should be a cautionary tale for any researcher who claims dramatic increases in IQ after an intervention. Unfortunately, the lessons have not been taken to heart, and such claims",

Mozart was not mentioned, but the report claimed that training on a difficult task of working memory resulted in a dramatic improvement on a test of fluid intelligence. As noted in Chapter 1, fluid intelligence (often expressed with the notation Gf) is highly correlated to the g-factor and many intelligence researchers regard them as synonymous terms. Moreover, this surprising finding was augmented by two important observations: the effect increased with more training, suggesting a kind of dose response, and the effect transferred from the memory training task to an entirely different test of abstract reasoning. The authors concluded, Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.",

In the 1-back version with letters, for example, whenever any letter is repeated twice in a row, that is the same letter is 1 back in the series, the participant presses a button. This is quite easy because it requires keeping only one letter in working memory until the next letter appears. If the next letter is not the same, no button is pressed and the new letter must now be remembered until the next letter appears. In the 2-back version, the button is pressed if the same letter was presented 2 letters before. This",

The person presses a button whenever the same element is repeated with one intervening element. The spatial position elements are presented one at a time visually and the letters are presented one at a time through headphones. In the dual version, both the spatial and the letter elements are presented simultaneously for 500 milliseconds each with 2,500 milliseconds between elements. This is illustrated in the top row of Figure 5.2. It shows a sequence of spatial positions (white squares) in elements presented one at a time starting on the left. The middle element should trigger a button press because it is a repeat of the identical element 2-back (the element on the left end of the row). The bottom row shows the letter version. The middle element C should trigger a button press because it is an identical repeat of the C 2-back (at the very left end of the row). The C at the right end of the row is also a trigger because it is an identical repeat of the middle C 2-back. Once a person learns to do this difficult memory task better than chance, they move on to the harder 3-back version, which in turn progresses to 4-back and 5-back versions, and so on until performance cannot be learned better than chance. This all is a bit tricky to understand the first time you read it, but once you get how the n-back works, youll appreciate how difficult the training becomes.

The missing figure must be determined from the logical rules derived from other components (shape, color, pattern, number, spatial arrangement of the elements of the figure). The person taking the test must recognize the structure of the matrix and select from six possible answers the one that allows the logical completion of the matrix. The Ravens test used a 3 x 3 matrix, so fewer elements are required to be retained in working memory while solving each item compared to the 5 x 3 matrix of elements used in the BOMAT. This is why the BOMAT is more of a working memory test and why it is similar to the n-back. This similarity undercuts the claim that training on the n-back transfers to a completely different test of fluid intelligence (Moody, 2009).",

Average n-back difficulty increased for the training group from about 3-back at the start to about 5-back at the end. The groups did not differ on the pre-test of abstract reasoning. Both groups showed average increased abstract reasoning scores at post-test. This was about a 1-point increase for the control group and about 2 points for the training group. Note these are not IQ points; they are the number of correctly answered items on the test. This small change was statistically significant and described as substantially superior. When the intelligence test score increase was graphed against days of practice, the group with 8 days showed less than a 1-point increase",

Moreover, we provide evidence that the amount of Gf gain critically depends on the amount of training time. Considering the fundamental importance of Gf in everyday life and its predictive power for a large variety of intellectual tasks and professional success, we believe that our findings may be highly relevant to applications in education.

Normally, the test-taker is given 45 minutes to complete as many of the 29 problems as possible. This important fact was omitted from the PNAS report. The PNAS study allowed only 10 minutes to complete the test, so any improvement was limited to relatively easy items because the time limit precluded getting to the harder items that are most predictive of Gf, especially in a sample of college students with restricted range. This non-standard administration of the test transformed the BOMAT from a test of fluid intelligence to a test of easy visual analogies with, at best, an unknown relationship to fluid intelligence. Interestingly, the one training group that was tested on the RAPM showed no improvement. A crucial difference between the two tests is that the BOMAT requires the test-taker to keep 14 visual figures in working memory to solve each problem, whereas the RAPM requires holding only eight in working memory (one element in each matrix is blank until the problem is solved). Thus, performance on the BOMAT is more heavily dependent on working memory. This is the exact nature of the n-back task, especially as the version used for training included the spatial position of matrix elements quite similar to the format used in the BOMAT problems (see Textbox 5.1). As noted by Moody, Rather than being entirely different from the test items on the BOMAT, this [n-back] task seems well- designed to facilitate performance on that test. When this flaw is considered along with the small samples and issues surrounding small change scores of single tests, it is hard to understand the peer review and editorial processes that led to a featured publication in PNAS which claimed an extraordinary finding that was contrary to the weight of evidence from hundreds of previous reports.",

They ignored warnings about IQ conversions and change scores, and they failed to note that 4 points is the estimated standard error of IQ tests. Other researchers quickly reanalyzed this meta-analysis (Bogg & Lasecki, 2015). They concluded the small effect reported by Au and colleagues likely resulted from the small sample sizes of most studies included in the meta-analysis because they were statistically underpowered and biased toward a spurious result. Therefore, they cautioned that the small training effects on Gf could be artifacts. Another comprehensive independent meta-analysis of 47 studies concluded that there were no sustainable transfer",

Most researchers remain highly skeptical and have moved on to other projects despite some earlier enthusiasm for the possibility of increasing Gf with memory training (Sternberg, 2008). The Shmozart paper effectively ended most research on the Mozart Effect.

This is more likely given that the children who improved the most on some training tasks were not the children who showed the greatest FR gains. Actually, the children who had the lowest FR before the training showed the greatest increase after training, suggesting the effect was due, at least in part, to regression to the mean (statistically, repeat scores on average tend to move back to the group mean).

Most reputable companies are careful to avoid making explicit claims about increasing intelligence. One company, however, claims in their 2014 report (downloaded from the Internet) that their brain-training program raises IQ an average of 15 points for their clients. Their clients who start the program with severe cognitive weakness show average gains of 22 IQ points. The report has many pages of impressive- looking statistical analyses, tables, and graphs that show apparently amazing results for users of their program, but does not list a single publication where the statistics and claims have undergone independent peer review. Other companies sometimes cite individual published research reports, especially with small samples, as evidence for the validity of computer training programs to increase mental performance. This kind of cherry-picking is quite common where only studies that support a claim are noted while ignoring other studies that do not. Neuro-education and brain-based learning are attractive concepts for educators but, in my view, there is not yet a compelling weight of evidence of successful applications so considerable caution is required (Geake, 2008, 2011; Howard-Jones, 2014). Potential buyers of such programs, especially of those claiming increases in intelligence, are advised to keep three words in mind before signing a contract or making a purchase: independent replication required.",

There are other interesting commonalities among these studies. Each claimed a finding that overturned long-standing findings from many previous studies. Each study was based on small samples. Each study measured putative cognitive gains with single test scores rather that extracting a latent factor like g from multiple measures. Each studys primary author was a young investigator and the more senior authors had few previous publications that depended on psychometric assessment of intelligence. In retrospect, is it surprising that numerous subsequent studies by independent, experienced investigators failed to replicate the original claims? There is a certain eagerness about showing that intelligence is malleable and can be increased with relatively simple",

This would save many years of effort and expense trying to replicate provocative claims based on fundamentally flawed studies and weak results.

Before leaving this section on increasing intelligence in children, there is another interesting and more optimistic report to consider. Whereas the three cases discussed so far are presented as cautionary examples, this one is a positive illustration of how progress in the field can be advanced more prudently. This report is based on meta-analyses of nearly every available intervention involving children from birth to kindergarten to increase intelligence (Protzko et al., 2013). These researchers from New York University (NYU) maintain the Database of Raising Intelligence. This database includes studies designed to increase intelligence that have the following components: a sample drawn from a general, non-clinical population; a pure randomized controlled experimental design; a sustained intervention; and a widely accepted, standardized measure of intelligence as an outcome variable. Four meta-analyses are reported on the effects of dietary supplementation to pregnant mothers and neonates, early educational interventions, interactive reading, and sending a child to preschool. Here is a summary of the main results for each of these four analyses.",

The NYU analyses incorporated 19 studies going as far back as 1968. Some had interventions that went on for more than 3 years. Although some individual studies did show IQ increases for some infants, all together the meta-analysis indicated that there was no appreciable effect on IQ. The third meta-analysis focused on interactive reading and incorporated 10 studies totaling 499 participants. For children under 4 years old, the meta-analysis indicated about a 6- point increase in IQ when the child was an active participant in the reading. The authors speculate that this intervention may influence language development which then indirectly influences IQ. Active reading is now widely recommended to parents. The fourth meta- analysis focused on preschool and included 16 studies of 7,370 participants, mostly with low family income backgrounds. All together the analysis indicated a 4-point increase in IQ but up to a 7-point increase for the subset of programs that included a specific emphasis on language development. Interestingly, longer preschool attendance was not related to greater increase in IQ points. How long any of the putative increases may last and the brain mechanisms that might be relevant are not yet known.",

The 2008 survey of scientists revealed that 20% already used drugs to improve concentration; 70% would risk mild side effects to boost brainpower; 80% defended their right to take such boosters; and greater than 33% would feel pressure to give their kids brain boosters if other kids used them. The survey report included four specific comments from responders that illustrated basic ethical issues: Safety: The mild side effects will add up to be profound in due course and may even require stronger therapy to control the addiction, wrote a young man from Nigeria. Erosion of character: J wouldnt use cognitive-enhancing drugs because I think it would be dishonest to myself and all the people who look to me as a role model, wrote a young person from Guyana.

          "context": "The first technique is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS uses a wand-like device containing a metal coil to produce strong magnetic field pulses when electricity is applied in short bursts. When the coil is placed over a part of the scalp, the magnetic field fluctuations pass through the scalp and skull undistorted into the brain. The fluctuations induce electrical currents that depolarize neurons in the underlying brain cortex. The rate of pulses and their intensity can be varied to increase or decrease cortical excitation. As a research tool, TMS can be used to test whether a particular region of cortex is involved in a cognitive task. For example, inducing cortical deactivation might result in poorer performance and inducing activation might result in better performance, or in the case of efficiency, vice versa. A review of over 60 TMS studies done over the last 15 years (Luber & Lisanby, 2014) concluded that this technique has promise for enhancing a range of cognitive tasks, although intelligence is not specifically discussed and this review is not a quantitative meta-analysis. According to the authors, TMS may affect brain mechanisms to increase task performance in at least two general ways: either by direct impact on neurons that increases the efficiency of task-relevant processing, or by disrupting processing that is task-irrelevant and distracting to performance. Some enhancement effects attributed to the first category are for tasks involving non-verbal working memory, visual analogic reasoning, mental rotation, and spatial working memory, among others (from their table 1). Enhancement effects attributed to the second category include tasks of verbal working memory, spatial attention, and sequential item memory (from their table 2). In addition to laboratory experiments, the authors also discuss some real-world applications for TMS, including cognitive rehabilitation after brain injury. So far the weight of evidence is not",

The currents are quite mild and the shocks barely noticeable. They are not used as punishment shocks for wrong responses to a cognitive task or like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which induces seizures that ameliorate deep clinical depression. tDCS currents are generated by a 9-volt battery and pass between electrodes on the scalp. Depending on the parameters used, this current can increase or decrease neuronal excitability under the electrode locations similar to the effect of TMS. Early tDCS studies were encouraging (Clark et al., 2012; Utz et al., 2010). Writing about enhancement effects for both TMS and tDCS, one research group (McKinley",

Because such jobs are plentiful in the military, it is no surprise that the US Air Force has recently begun investing in non-invasive brain stimulation for its efficacy in benefiting human cognitive performance. Another group reviewed tDCS enhancement effects from many studies of attention, learning, and memory in healthy adults (Coffman et al., 2014). This qualitative review concluded that battery-powered thought had considerable potential for certain cognitive tasks, although the review did not address intelligence directly. This review included some research on how tDCS might influence brain mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancements. They noted possible roles for aspects of glutamate, GABA, NAA, NMDA, and BDNF regulation and function (see similar findings from molecular genetic studies noted in Chapter 4). Predictably, however, a newer comprehensive quantitative analysis of tDCS and cognition in healthy adults was",

They describe how laser light affects the brain this way: Photoneuromodulation involves the absorption of photons by specific molecules in neurons that activate bioenergetic signaling pathways after exposure to red-to-near-infrared light. Imagine this special laser light aimed from a distance at an unsuspecting persons brain to either enhance or disrupt cognition. Sounds like a screenplay idea. Enough speculation.

Moreover, my assertion that enhancement is an important goal is not universally recognized.

There is a recent noteworthy development in genetic engineering technology, however, with implications for enhancement possibilities. A new method for editing the human genome is called CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas genes). I dont understand the name either, but this method uses bacteria to edit the genome of living cells by making changes to targeted genes (Sander & Joung, 2014). It is noteworthy because many researchers can apply this method routinely so that editing the entire human genome is possible as a mainstream activity. Once genes for intelligence and how they function are identified, this kind of technology could provide the means for enhancement on a large scale. Perhaps that is why the name of the method was chosen to be incomprehensible to most of us. Keep this one on your radar too.",

PET is more complex than EEG; functional MRI is more complex than structural MRI; MRI spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are more complex than structural or functional MRI; MEG is more complex than MRI. Each new technology provides better spatial and temporal resolutions and amasses bigger and bigger data files that require more advanced computer power for processing and analyses. MRI shows brain tissue in millimeters, but even this is far too big for showing individual neurons or synapses. MEG shows brain activity changes every millisecond, but this is far too slow to show nanosecond neurochemical events in the synapse. Neuroscience techniques are available to study the brain at the level of single neurons and synapses, so it is not beyond imagination that these techniques can be applied to questions about intelligence. Advances in the intelligence field likely will come from the integration of findings from basic research on clinical brain disorders, aging, and normal cognitive processes like learning, memory, and attention from both animal and human studies that expose events smaller and smaller, faster and faster, and deeper and deeper in the brain.",

On the other side of the equation, we have a psychometric test score, often from a single test that costs a few dollars. This is quite a mismatch, or more accurately a chasm. Decades ago, the earliest imaging studies of intelligence and the earliest quantitative and molecular genetic studies of intelligence used the same intelligence tests still used today. To advance the field, the study of intelligence can no longer be limited to psychometric test scores. As noted in Chapter 1, a sophisticated measurement of intelligence is badly needed to match the sophisticated genetic and neuroimaging assessments widely available. At minimum, a latent variable approach that extracts a factor from a battery of tests is required. The optimal assessment of intelligence will require a ratio scale, as noted in Chapter |.",

If you are at the 95th percentile, how much more intelligent are you than someone at the 90th percentile? You are not 5% more intelligent. We do not have a measure of intelligence as a quantity. In Chapter 4, we discussed whether intelligence could be defined by quantifying brain characteristics like the amount of gray matter, thickness of the cortex, connectivity of networks, or the integrity of white matter. These are all potential ratio scales, but imaging is not a practical basis for wide use as an intelligence test in most settings. Another way to create a ratio measurement of intelligence depends on the measurement of time (8 seconds is literally twice 4 seconds). The concept is to create a standard battery of mental tests where the time it takes to arrive at an answer is the basis for the measurement rather than the number of correct answers. Intelligence could then be defined as speed of information processing during a standard set of test items. A person who had an average time of 4 seconds on a battery of information-processing test items would be literally twice as fast as a person with an average of 8 seconds. The validity of information-processing speed as an alternative definition of intelligence would require research establishing what this metric might predict in terms of academic or other achievement. In fact, a considerable body of research like this already exists.",

After a series of trials on this test, few people make many mistakes and test results are measured in units of time, so chronometric scores are on ratio scales. If research supports the validity and reliability of the chronometric approach by establishing correlations with intelligence test scores, its use in future genetic and neuroimaging studies could narrow the sophistication-of-measurement gap.

One of the most replicated findings is that RT increases with task complexity. Another core finding is that people with faster RTs generally have higher IQ scores. Therefore, the measurement of RT could be used to measure intelligence and RT is an especially attractive metric because time is a",

This lack of uniformity introduces method variance that confounds the RT assessment of individuals and makes it difficult to compare studies or to combine data from different studies into a large data set. Jensen proposed building a standard device to test RT to a standard set of diverse ECTs. Jensen believed that the combination of RT measures with a standardized method for testing ECTs would advance the study of intelligence beyond the limitations of psychometric tests like the WAIS. The Institute of Mental Chronometry (IMC) was founded and funded by Jensen to develop and disseminate such a device. At this time a prototype is under development. The device has a combined display screen and a button response panel with eight buttons arranged in a semi-circle and a home button below the semi-circle. A keyboard and mouse can be attached so the investigator can set parameters for any experiment.",

He uses mnemonic methods (i.e., memory tricks see Textbox 6.2) that allow the storage and retrieval of large amounts of information. One fMRI study recruited several participants in the World Memory Championships and found several brain areas were activated when mnemonic procedures were used (Maguire ef al., 2003). Unfortunately, each participant used a different mnemonic strategy, so the imaging results were not easily interpretable.

Before memorizing the digits, create a list of words to represent 100 pairs of sequential digits.

Assign a word to the combination of 0,2 and another word for 0,3 and so on for 0,4... 5,0, 5,1... 9,9. The words can be, for example, animals, tools, famous historical figures or anything you choose. As you begin to memorize the long string of numbers convert sequential pairs to your pre- memorized list of 100 words and create a story linking each consecutive word. The more outrageous the story, the easier it is to remember. Lets say this is your standard list of words for each two-digit combination (showing only 8 of 100",

When tested on multiple test batteries, the overall performance ranks of individuals were found to be highly reliable and were normally distributed. Factor analysis of learning performance variables determined that a single factor accounted for 38% of the total variance across animals. Animals levels of native activity and body weights accounted for little of the variability in learning, although animals propensity for exploration loaded strongly (and was positively correlated) with learning abilities.

The key neurochemical change involves proteins within the neuron. The electrical pulse stimulates the protein to create a new pulse to fire the next neurons in the circuit, and this cascade of firing continues until inhibitory signals diminish or stop the firing. Optogenetic techniques create light-sensitive proteins in specific populations of neurons. These neuron clusters can be induced to fire by applying light in",

One key insight is that the elements of this system are integrated by a single, all-purpose cortical learning algorithm (CLA). Therefore, Hawkins believes that the AI approach of designing separate elements of the system for machines is inherently limited. He believes that it is possible to design machines based on an all-purpose CLA, and that such machines might exceed human mental abilities.

To succeed, we will need to crib heavily from natures engine of intelligence, the neocortex. We have to extract intelligence from within the brain. No other road will get us there (p. 39). Hawkins has created the Redwood Neurosciences Institute and a company called Numenta to make brain-informed intelligent machines a reality. Numenta markets software based on algorithms that identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in large data sets. The approach is controversial, especially because it challenges the AI computational approaches widely used by companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. It is too early to evaluate how the hierarchical CLA concept might relate to the hierarchical g-factor, but it clearly fits the theme of this chapter on neuroscience approaches to intelligence and where they might lead (see an informative online interview with Hawkins from March 20, 2014 with Jack Clark of The Register, www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/29/hawkins_ai_feature).",

They undertook to create an artificial brain by building biologically realistic models of neurons and networks. Working with an IBM Big Blue supercomputer, they simulated brain activity starting with about 10,000 virtual neurons. This ambitious Blue Brain project expanded dramatically in 2009 when the European Union provided additional funding of $1.3 billion and many additional collaborators joined the endeavor, renamed the Human Brain Project. The stated goal is to simulate a human brain, all 80-100 billion neurons with 100 trillion connections. No neuroscience project has ever received this level of support. There is no shortage of controversy about every aspect of this project, but the most important issue for us is that cognitive neuroscience was excluded from the project. This likely will be reversed given the outcry from the cognitive neuroscience community",

In 2013, the White House announced the BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies), which provided funding for projects that will lead to detailed functional and structural maps of the brain. This initiative builds on other collaborations already funded like the Human Connectome Project, which is one of the few to include cognitive tests from which a g-factor can be derived.

This is a breathtaking study not only for the findings, but also because it fulfills a dream I have had for 40 years about using brain profiles to describe individuals and their mental abilities. Heres what they reported based on analyses of connectivity patterns among brain areas (like those shown in Figure 4.1). They started with fMRI data from 126 people collected during six sessions, including four task and two resting conditions. The typical analysis would have compared the average connectivity for the entire group among the task and rest conditions. These researchers, however, focused on individual differences. The simple question was whether connectivity patterns were stable within a person. To address this question, functional connectivity patterns among 268 brain nodes (making up 10 networks) were calculated for each person separately for each session. Not only was the comnectivity pattern stable within a person when the two resting conditions were compared, it was also stable across the four different tasks. In addition, each persons pattern was unique enough that it could be used to identify the person. Because these remarkable results combined stability and uniqueness, the connectivity pattern was characterized as a brain fingerprint. Of particular interest to us, individual brain fingerprints predicted individual differences in fluid intelligence. It gets even better. The strongest correlations with fluid intelligence were in frontoparietal networks. And, best of all, cross-validation was included in the report. The authors note, These results underscore the potential to discover {MRI-based connectivity neuromarkers of present or future behavior that may eventually be used to personalize educational and clinical practices and improve outcomes. They conclude, Together, these findings suggest that analysis of individual fMRI data is possible and indeed desirable. Given this foundation, human neuroimaging studies have an opportunity to move beyond population-level",

There is some overlap between creativity and intelligence (Haier & Jung, 2008; Jung, 2014). Creativity and the creative process are even more difficult to define and assess for empirical research than intelligence and reasoning. The same general approach, however, is applicable. A battery of tests that assesses different aspects of creativity is given and a creativity index is derived either by summing the scores of individual tests (like IQ scores) or by extracting a latent creativity variable like the g-factor. Aspects of creativity include, for example, measures of originality, fluency of ideas, and divergent thinking.

However, there are apparently rare cases where people have demonstrated a dramatic new creative ability, often artistic, after they develop frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a degenerating illness similar to Alzheimers disease. This observation is not typical for FTD patients (Miller et al., 1998, 2000; Rankin et al., 2007). This is intriguing because it raises the possibility that creativity might be unleashed in more people if only certain brain conditions changed, although dementia is hardly a positive change. The general idea, however, is that dis-inhibition (i.e., deactivation) of neural circuits and networks caused by the disease process is a key factor, because dis- inhibition allows more associations among brain areas that do not routinely communicate. There are many ways to dis-inhibit the brain in general, like drinking alcohol or developing FTD, but dis-inhibition targeted to particular neural networks related to creativity may be possible without affecting other networks necessary for balance, coordination, memory, and judgment.

The results of this small study suggested that compared to the over-learned sequence, improvisation was associated with a combination of bilateral deactivation in some areas, especially parts of the prefrontal cortex (including BAs 8, 9, and 46), along with bilateral activation in other areas distributed across the brain including in the frontal lobe (BA 10). These findings are shown in Figure 6.2. A similar fMRI study of 12 male freestyle rap musicians compared spontaneous creation of rap lyrics to previously memorized sequences, both conditions using the same musical background (Liu et al., 2012). The results also suggested a pattern of deactivations and activations, as shown in Figure 6.3, which is mostly consistent with the results of the Limb and Braun study of jazz pianists. Another study of 39 pianists with varying degrees of improvisation experience reported an association between length of experience and connectivity among brain areas that suggested more efficient information flow during creative expression for the more experienced musicians (Pinho ef al., 2014). Less activity in frontal and parietal areas was associated with more improvisation experience as shown in Figure 6.4. A meta-analysis of musical improvisation studies like these tried to integrate findings and explain inconsistencies among studies (Beaty, 2015), but this research is still at an early stage and little consistency is apparent.

Although the context for his paper is cognitive epidemiology, the argument applies to all research using SES as a variable. Essentially, if a study incorporates measures of both SES and intelligence, statistical methods can help disentangle their respective effects. The interpretation of results from any study of SES cannot disentangle which factor is driving the result unless a measure of intelligence is included in the study. Studies of intelligence without considering SES are also problematic. When both variables are included in multivariate studies in large samples, the results typically show that general cognitive ability measures correlate with a particular variable of interest even after the effects of SES are statistically removed. For example, in a study of 641 Brazilian school children, SES did not predict scholastic achievement, but intelligence test scores did (Colom & Flores-Mendoza, 2007). An even larger classic",

An illustrative example of using both SES and IQ is a study of 110 disadvantaged middle- school children. It included maternal IQ along with composite measures of parental nurturance and environmental stimulation (Farah et al., 2008). In the main analysis, parental nurturance was related to memory and environmental stimulation was related to language, after any effects of maternal IQ were statistically removed. The range of maternal IQ, however, was restricted to the lower end of the normal distribution (mean = 83, standard deviation = 9), possibly explaining the lack of an IQ finding, but this study does illustrate why it is important to include IQ measures when investigating specific SES factors. Replication in another sample of disadvantaged children would be important along with obtaining fathers IQ. Replication in a sample of children in higher SES levels would also be informative, as would studies of children at different ages since the effects of SES on the heritability of intelligence may vary with age (Hanscombe ef al., 2012). It is particularly interesting that there is emerging evidence that the SES itself has a strong",

This was a primary point made two decades ago in The Bell Curve. Nonetheless, bias toward SES-only explanations remains prevalent. Two recent high-profile examples illustrate the issue. Both studies use neuroimaging with structural MRI. The first paper is from MIT, reported by Dr. Mackey and colleagues (2015) (Mackey also reported a 10- point IQ increase in disadvantaged children following brief computer game playing in school; see Section 5.3). These researchers set out to study neuroanatomical correlates of the academic achievement gap between higher- and lower-income students (n = 35 and 23, respectively). The higher group average yearly family income was $145,465 (95% confidence interval between $122,461 and $168,470). The lower group family average was $46,353 (95% CI between $22,665 and $70,041). It is arguable whether family incomes of over $50,000 constitute a disadvantaged household, but the key finding is still of interest. Structural MRIs showed greater cortical thickness in several areas for the high- income group, although other brain measures did not (e.g., cortical surface area, cortical white matter volume). Cortical thickness differences between the groups in some areas were related to standard test score differences. The authors concluded, Future studies will show how effective educational practices support academic gains and whether these practices alter cortical anatomy. This is fair enough and certainly supports a commonly held view. However, without assessing the cognitive ability of the parents, we cannot be",

Income was related to brain surface area even after controlling for parental education. Parental education related to other structural brain characteristics even after controlling for income. These associations were found irrespective of genetic ancestry. The authors state that... in our correlational, non-experimental results, it is unclear what is driving the links between SES and brain structure. Such associations could stem from ongoing disparities in postnatal experience or exposures, such as family stress, cognitive stimulation, environmental toxins or nutrition, or from corresponding differences in the prenatal environment. If this correlational evidence reflects a possible underlying causal relationship, then policies targeting families at the low end of the income distribution may be most likely to lead to observable differences in childrens brain and cognitive development. This is not an unreasonable statement, but one implication of this train of thought might be an experiment that provided modest or large monthly payments to low- income families to improve everyday life with the expectation that the resulting life changes might have subsequent effects on their childrens brain and cognitive development. Some recognition and discussion of the neuroscience aspects of intelligence and its intertwining with SES would be important considerations if such an experiment was undertaken. Intelligence was not mentioned in the discussion of these MRI results.",

This goes beyond providing economic opportunities that might be unrealistic for individuals lacking the requisite mental abilities. It goes beyond demanding more complex thinking and higher expectations for every student irrespective of their capabilities (a demand that is likely to accentuate cognitive gaps). It even goes beyond supporting programs for early childhood education, jobs training, affordable childcare, food assistance, and access to higher education. There is no compelling evidence that any of these things increase intelligence, but I support all these efforts because they will help many people advance in other ways and because they are the right thing to do. However, even if this support becomes widely available, there will be many people at the lower end of the g-distribution who do not benefit very much, despite best efforts.

This is in contrast to the view that programs which target only social/cultural influences on intelligence can diminish cognitive gaps and overcome biological/genetic influences. The weight of evidence suggests a neuroscience approach might be even more effective as we learn more about the roots of intelligence. I am not arguing that neurobiology alone is the only approach, but it should not be ignored any longer in favor of SES-only approaches. What works best is an empirical question, although political context cannot be ignored. On the political level, the idea of treating neuro-poverty like it is a neurological disorder is supremely naive. This might change in the long run if neuroscience research ever leads to ways to enhance intelligence, as I believe it will. For now, epigenetics is one concept that might bridge both neuroscience and social science approaches. Nothing will advance epigenetic research faster than identifying specific genes related to intelligence so that the ways environmental factors influence those genes can be determined. There is common ground to discuss and that includes what we know about the neuroscience of intelligence from the weight of empirical evidence. It is time to bring intelligence back from a 45-year exile and into reasonable discussions about education and social policies without acrimony.",

Authored by two behavioral genetics researchers, the starting point is acknowledgment that all students enter the education system with different genetic propensities for learning reading, writing, and arithmetic (Asbury & Plomin, 2014). The authors propose policy ideas for tailoring the education environment to help each student learn core material in a way that is likely best suited to that students genetic endowment. This is a long way from the incorrect assumption that genes are deterministic; actually, genes are starting points. As the authors note, genetic research findings are uniquely excluded from discussions about education while at the same time genetic research has transformed aspects of medicine, public health, agriculture, energy, and the law. Individualized education is a long-time goal for educators, and genetic research supports that goal. Asbury and Plomin conclude, We aim to treat all children with equal respect and provide them with equal opportunities, but we do not believe that",

The reality of individual differences thus need not mean educational rewards for some children and frustration and defeat for others (p. 117). Both views are common among neuroscientists who study intelligence and understand the probabilistic nature of genes. Nonetheless, failure to acknowledge the conclusive findings about the role of genetics for individual differences in intelligence and other cognitive abilities perpetuates the ineffective one size fits all approach to education reform. It is easy to see how ignoring what we know about intelligence has led, and will continue to lead, to frustration and failure for addressing any issue where intelligence matters (Gottfredson, 2005). Nonetheless, intelligence remains missing from public conversations.",

The idea that every high school student be held to a graduation standard of four-year college-readiness, irrespective of mental ability, is naive and grossly unfair to those students for whom this expectation is unrealistic. Remember, statistically half of the high school student population has an IQ score of 100 or lower, making college work considerably difficult even in highly motivated individuals. It is similarly naive and unfair to evaluate teachers by student test score changes when many tests are largely de facto measures of general intelligence rather than of the amount of course material learned over a short time period. Perhaps the greatest disservice to students will come from purposefully increasing the difficulty of evaluation tests by requiring more complex thinking to get the right answers. The odds are that this change alone will increase performance gaps because the tests are now more g-loaded.
