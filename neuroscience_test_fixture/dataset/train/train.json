The experience of hearing doesnt arrive immediately: people have to learn to interpret the foreign dialect of the signals fed to the brain.

My brain gradually learned how to interpret the alien signal. Before long, Zzzzzz szz szvizzz ur brfzzzzzz? became What did you have for breakfast? After months of practice, I could use the telephone again, even converse in loud bars and cafeterias. Retinal implants work on similar principles. The tiny electrodes of the retinal implant bypass the normal functions of the photoreceptor sheet, sending out their tiny sparks of electrical activity. These implants are used mostly for eye diseases in which the photoreceptors at the back of the eye are degenerating, but in which the cells of the optic nerve remain healthy.

It is obvious that no matter how you define intelligence, it must have something to do with the brain. Among the many myths about intelligence, perhaps the most pernicious is that intelligence is a concept too amorphous and ill-defined for scientific study. In fact, the definitions and measures used for research are sufficiently developed for empirical investigations and have been so for over 100 years. This long research tradition used various kinds of mental ability tests and sophisticated statistical methods known collectively as psychometrics. The new science of intelligence builds on that database and melds it with new technologies of the last two decades or so, especially genetic and neuroimaging methods. These advances, the main focus of this book, are helping evolve a more neuroscience-oriented approach to intelligence research. The trajectory of this research is similar to that in other scientific fields, which has led from better measurement tools to more sophisticated definitions and understandings of, for example, an atom and a gene.

Here is an informative example. From time to time, a college admissions representative will assert that in their institution they find no relationship between grade point average (GPA) and SAT scores. Such observations are virtually always based on a lack of understanding of a basic statistical principle regarding the correlation between two variables. To calculate a correlation between any two variables, there must be a wide range of scores for each variable. At a place like MIT, for example, most students fall in a narrow range of high SAT scores. This is a classic problem of restriction of range. There is little variance among the students, so in this case, the relationship between GPA and SAT scores will not be very strong. Sampling from just the high end or just the low end or just the middle of a distribution restricts range and results in spuriously low or zero correlations. Restriction of range actually accounts for many findings about what intelligence test scores fail to predict. Heres another classic example of an erroneous finding due to restriction of range.

He then argued that one reason for this would be that variance in intelligence, especially the g-factor, was mostly genetic. He summarized genetic studies that appeared to validate this view. In 1969, this conclusion was a bit of a stretch given the paucity of both environmental and genetic studies with large samples and solid research designs.

DNA analysis generally breaks strands into fragments using any of several techniques. One technical breakthrough allowed the identification of small variations in the DNA sequence at any point on a strand where a base pair is changed or mutated.

In this study, not only was the number of copies of CON2 associated with IQ scores, the association was linear. That is, the more copies of CON2, the higher the IQ score.

In 2000, however, one group of researchers claimed their PET study showed that the neural basis of the g-factor was derived from a specific lateral frontal lobe system and downplayed the importance of other regions (Duncan et al., 2000). They imaged blood flow over a 2-minute period as 13 subjects (with the wide age range of 21-34) performed a small number of problems that varied in g-loadings.

As for interpretation, none of the previous PET studies showing distributed areas related to high g-scores were cited, so there was no acknowledgment or discussion of inverse correlations or a distributed network of areas other than in the frontal lobe. And their own data for the high-g task showed activation in multiple areas outside the frontal lobes. Subsequently, Dr. John Duncan, the research leader, apparently abandoned the frontal lobe-centered model of intelligence and came to the view that other areas also were involved (Bishop et al., 2008; Duncan, 2010), consistent with virtually all other studies available at that time (Jung & Haier, 2007).

We include studies of adults and children, patients with brain damage, and introduce more advanced methods of brain image acquisition and analysis. These studies continue to intrigue and motivate researchers worldwide to push assessment technologies to even greater precision, increase the sample sizes to levels previously unimaginable, and offer new, testable hypotheses about intelligence and the brain. One word of caution: most of the studies in the last chapter and many in this chapter have sample sizes that are too small for conclusive interpretations. Remember our second law no one study is definitive. As this field continues to mature, sample sizes are increasing rather dramatically.

Presumably, different cognitive domains require different brain networks so various brain measures for different domains might be combined to predict IQ.

The most basic one applied for predicting IQ scores is the multiple regression equation. This method and related versions of it use the correlation between IQ and each measure after removing common relationships between measures. For example, if variable Acorrelates to IQ and so do variables B and C, they cannot be simply combined without first statistically removing the common variance between A and B, A and C, and B and C. The remaining correlations to IQ for each variable are called partial correlations. Regression equations combine partial correlations between each variable and IQ along with computing weights for each variable that maximize the IQ prediction. In the ABC example, A might be weighted more than B and B might be weighted more than C in order to make the strongest IQ prediction. The resulting equation can then be applied to a new persons data and an IQ score predicted. The correlation between a predicted IQ score and the actual IQ score for a large group of individuals must be nearly perfect for the equation to be acceptable as a substitute for an actual IQ score. It is not sufficient if an equation produces a statistically significant correlation between the predicted IQ and the actual IQ. Whenever a regression equation is calculated in a research sample, the exact same equation must be applied to an independent sample so the predicted and actual IQ score correlation can be replicated. This is cross-validation of the equation and this step is required because the original equation may produce a spuriously high correlation by incorporating chance effects, especially in small samples.

To account for the imprecision of average brain anatomy, analyses typically add a step of smoothing in an effort to minimize the imprecision. Nonetheless, forcing all brains into a standard space introduces error into efforts to predict IQ from images. Some template methods create more error than others. Consider a neuroimaging study of male/female differences. Should the males be standardized to a male template and the females to a female template, or should everyone be standardized to the same template? Many neuroimaging studies use a standard template supplied by the analysis software and other studies create a template from only the participants in the study.

MMPI scores from the different subscales can be used in regression analyses, but the analysis of individual profiles allows comparisons of groups of people defined by similar profiles across the subscales to determine variables related to the profile type. We illustrated this approach for predicting intelligence by creating profiles of individuals based on the amount of gray matter in several PFIT areas and tried to relate the profile to IQ score (Haier, 2009b).

They expanded this approach using DTI and DNA data from a sample of 472 twins and their non-twin siblings. The basic idea was to use statistical methods of clustering many variables based on their similarity. First, thousands of points within white matter fibers were clustered to find brain systems with common genetic determination. The white matter measure was FA, as described previously. Then they used DNA in a genome-wide scan and network analyses to identify a network of genes that was related to white matter integrity in major tracts. FA in some hubs in the white matter network was related to IQ scores (their figure 9).

There is a long road between observations like these and making any practical use of them.

TMS uses a wand-like device containing a metal coil to produce strong magnetic field pulses when electricity is applied in short bursts. When the coil is placed over a part of the scalp, the magnetic field fluctuations pass through the scalp and skull undistorted into the brain. The fluctuations induce electrical currents that depolarize neurons in the underlying brain cortex. The rate of pulses and their intensity can be varied to increase or decrease cortical excitation. As a research tool, TMS can be used to test whether a particular region of cortex is involved in a cognitive task. For example, inducing cortical deactivation might result in poorer performance and inducing activation might result in better performance, or in the case of efficiency, vice versa. A review of over 60 TMS studies done over the last 15 years (Luber & Lisanby, 2014) concluded that this technique has promise for enhancing a range of cognitive tasks, although intelligence is not specifically discussed and this review is not a quantitative meta-analysis. According to the authors, TMS may affect brain mechanisms to increase task performance in at least two general ways: either by direct impact on neurons that increases the efficiency of task-relevant processing, or by disrupting processing that is task-irrelevant and distracting to performance. Some enhancement effects attributed to the first category are for tasks involving non-verbal working memory, visual analogic reasoning, mental rotation, and spatial working memory, among others (from their table 1). Enhancement effects attributed to the second category include tasks of verbal working memory, spatial attention, and sequential item memory (from their table 2).

They started with fMRI data from 126 people collected during six sessions, including four task and two resting conditions. The typical analysis would have compared the average connectivity for the entire group among the task and rest conditions. These researchers, however, focused on individual differences. The simple question was whether connectivity patterns were stable within a person. To address this question, functional connectivity patterns among 268 brain nodes (making up 10 networks) were calculated for each person separately for each session. Not only was the comnectivity pattern stable within a person when the two resting conditions were compared, it was also stable across the four different tasks. In addition, each persons pattern was unique enough that it could be used to identify the person. Because these remarkable results combined stability and uniqueness, the connectivity pattern was characterized as a brain fingerprint. Of particular interest to us, individual brain fingerprints predicted individual differences in fluid intelligence. It gets even better. The strongest correlations with fluid intelligence were in frontoparietal networks. And, best of all, cross-validation was included in the report.

Structural MRIs showed greater cortical thickness in several areas for the high- income group, although other brain measures did not (e.g., cortical surface area, cortical white matter volume). Cortical thickness differences between the groups in some areas were related to standard test score differences.
