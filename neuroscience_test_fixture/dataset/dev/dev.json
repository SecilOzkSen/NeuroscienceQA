Compelling evidence shows that genetics play a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function. He dispels common misconceptions such as the belief that IQ tests are biased or meaningless and debunks simple interventions alleged to increase intelligence. Readers will learn about the real possibility of dramatically enhancing intelligence based on neuroscience findings and the positive implications this could have for education and social policy.

It is obvious that no matter how you define intelligence, it must have something to do with the brain. Among the many myths about intelligence, perhaps the most pernicious is that intelligence is a concept too amorphous and ill-defined for scientific study. In fact, the definitions and measures used for research are sufficiently developed for empirical investigations and have been so for over 100 years. This long research tradition used various kinds of mental ability tests and sophisticated statistical methods known collectively as psychometrics. The new science of intelligence builds on that database and melds it with new technologies of the last two decades or so, especially genetic and neuroimaging methods. These advances, the main focus of this book, are helping evolve a more neuroscience-oriented approach to intelligence research. The trajectory of this research is similar to that in other scientific fields, which has led from better measurement tools to more sophisticated definitions and understandings of, for example, an atom and a gene. Before we address the brain in subsequent chapters, this chapter reviews the current state of basic intelligence research issues regarding the definition of intelligence as a general mental ability, the measurement of intelligence relative to other people, and the validity of intelligence test scores for", "qas": [{"answers": [{"start": 800, "text": "over 100 years"}], "question": "How long has research on intelligence been going on?", "id": "pgyhyqxjb10bfxww7rnxyxwz"}]}, {"context": "It may seem odd, but lets start our discussion of intelligence with the value of pi, the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter.

Here is an informative example. From time to time, a college admissions representative will assert that in their institution they find no relationship between grade point average (GPA) and SAT scores. Such observations are virtually always based on a lack of understanding of a basic statistical principle regarding the correlation between two variables. To calculate a correlation between any two variables, there must be a wide range of scores for each variable. At a place like MIT, for example, most students fall in a narrow range of high SAT scores. This is a classic problem of restriction of range. There is little variance among the students, so in this case, the relationship between GPA and SAT scores will not be very strong. Sampling from just the high end or just the low end or just the middle of a distribution restricts range and results in spuriously low or zero correlations. Restriction of range actually accounts for many findings about what intelligence test scores fail to predict. Heres another classic example of an erroneous finding due to restriction of range.

In 2000, however, one group of researchers claimed their PET study showed that the neural basis of the g-factor was derived from a specific lateral frontal lobe system and downplayed the importance of other regions (Duncan et al., 2000). They imaged blood flow over a 2-minute period as 13 subjects (with the wide age range of 21-34) performed a small number of problems that varied in g-loadings.

Imaging occurred during a few problems while subjects worked at their own pace so the task reliability was low and averaging over subjects could minimize any differences due to differences in speed of responding to the problems. As for interpretation, none of the previous PET studies showing distributed areas related to high g-scores were cited, so there was no acknowledgment or discussion of inverse correlations or a distributed network of areas other than in the frontal lobe. And their own data for the high-g task showed activation in multiple areas outside the frontal lobes. Subsequently, Dr. John Duncan, the research leader, apparently abandoned the frontal lobe-centered model of intelligence and came to the view that other areas also were involved (Bishop et al., 2008; Duncan, 2010), consistent with virtually all other studies available at that time (Jung & Haier, 2007).

Presumably, different cognitive domains require different brain networks so various brain measures for different domains might be combined to predict IQ.

The most basic one applied for predicting IQ scores is the multiple regression equation. This method and related versions of it use the correlation between IQ and each measure after removing common relationships between measures. For example, if variable Acorrelates to IQ and so do variables B and C, they cannot be simply combined without first statistically removing the common variance between A and B, A and C, and B and C. The remaining correlations to IQ for each variable are called partial correlations. Regression equations combine partial correlations between each variable and IQ along with computing weights for each variable that maximize the IQ prediction. In the ABC example, A might be weighted more than B and B might be weighted more than C in order to make the strongest IQ prediction. The resulting equation can then be applied to a new persons data and an IQ score predicted. The correlation between a predicted IQ score and the actual IQ score for a large group of individuals must be nearly perfect for the equation to be acceptable as a substitute for an actual IQ score. It is not sufficient if an equation produces a statistically significant correlation between the predicted IQ and the actual IQ. Whenever a regression equation is calculated in a research sample, the exact same equation must be applied to an independent sample so the predicted and actual IQ score correlation can be replicated. This is cross-validation of the equation and this step is required because the original equation may produce a spuriously high correlation by incorporating chance effects, especially in small samples.

No two brains are the same structurally or functionally, even in identical twins. Virtually all brain image analysis starts with morphing each brain into a standard size and shape, called a template.

To account for the imprecision of average brain anatomy, analyses typically add a step of smoothing in an effort to minimize the imprecision. Nonetheless, forcing all brains into a standard space introduces error into efforts to predict IQ from images. Some template methods create more error than others. Consider a neuroimaging study of male/female differences. Should the males be standardized to a male template and the females to a female template, or should everyone be standardized to the same template? Many neuroimaging studies use a standard template supplied by the analysis software and other studies create a template from only the participants in the study. No one way is always correct, but the issue presents a problem for efforts to predict IQ. A study of 100 postmortem brains highlights the issue (Witelson et al., 2006).

MMPI scores from the different subscales can be used in regression analyses, but the analysis of individual profiles allows comparisons of groups of people defined by similar profiles across the subscales to determine variables related to the profile type. We illustrated this approach for predicting intelligence by creating profiles of individuals based on the amount of gray matter in several PFIT areas and tried to relate the profile to IQ score (Haier, 2009b).

They expanded this approach using DTI and DNA data from a sample of 472 twins and their non-twin siblings. The basic idea was to use statistical methods of clustering many variables based on their similarity. First, thousands of points within white matter fibers were clustered to find brain systems with common genetic determination. The white matter measure was FA, as described previously. Then they used DNA in a genome-wide scan and network analyses to identify a network of genes that was related to white matter integrity in major tracts. FA in some hubs in the white matter network was related to IQ scores (their figure 9).

There is a long road between observations like these and making any practical use of them.

This non-standard administration of the test transformed the BOMAT from a test of fluid intelligence to a test of easy visual analogies with, at best, an unknown relationship to fluid intelligence. Interestingly, the one training group that was tested on the RAPM showed no improvement. A crucial difference between the two tests is that the BOMAT requires the test-taker to keep 14 visual figures in working memory to solve each problem, whereas the RAPM requires holding only eight in working memory (one element in each matrix is blank until the problem is solved). Thus, performance on the BOMAT is more heavily dependent on working memory.

TMS uses a wand-like device containing a metal coil to produce strong magnetic field pulses when electricity is applied in short bursts. When the coil is placed over a part of the scalp, the magnetic field fluctuations pass through the scalp and skull undistorted into the brain. The fluctuations induce electrical currents that depolarize neurons in the underlying brain cortex. The rate of pulses and their intensity can be varied to increase or decrease cortical excitation. As a research tool, TMS can be used to test whether a particular region of cortex is involved in a cognitive task. For example, inducing cortical deactivation might result in poorer performance and inducing activation might result in better performance, or in the case of efficiency, vice versa. A review of over 60 TMS studies done over the last 15 years (Luber & Lisanby, 2014) concluded that this technique has promise for enhancing a range of cognitive tasks, although intelligence is not specifically discussed and this review is not a quantitative meta-analysis. According to the authors, TMS may affect brain mechanisms to increase task performance in at least two general ways: either by direct impact on neurons that increases the efficiency of task-relevant processing, or by disrupting processing that is task-irrelevant and distracting to performance. Some enhancement effects attributed to the first category are for tasks involving non-verbal working memory, visual analogic reasoning, mental rotation, and spatial working memory, among others (from their table 1). Enhancement effects attributed to the second category include tasks of verbal working memory, spatial attention, and sequential item memory (from their table 2).

Depending on the parameters used, this current can increase or decrease neuronal excitability under the electrode locations similar to the effect of TMS.

Each new technology provides better spatial and temporal resolutions and amasses bigger and bigger data files that require more advanced computer power for processing and analyses. MRI shows brain tissue in millimeters, but even this is far too big for showing individual neurons or synapses. MEG shows brain activity changes every millisecond, but this is far too slow to show nanosecond neurochemical events in the synapse. Neuroscience techniques are available to study the brain at the level of single neurons and synapses, so it is not beyond imagination that these techniques can be applied to questions about intelligence. Advances in the intelligence field likely will come from the integration of findings from basic research on clinical brain disorders, aging, and normal cognitive processes like learning, memory, and attention from both animal and human studies that expose events smaller and smaller, faster and faster, and deeper and deeper in the brain.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"start": 0, "text": ""}], "question": "MRI is more complex than what?", "id": "4ugnehv3zed5plvfbaab07mv"}]}, {"context": "This chapter will highlight six developing lines of inquiry relevant to intelligence.

To advance the field, the study of intelligence can no longer be limited to psychometric test scores. As noted in Chapter 1, a sophisticated measurement of intelligence is badly needed to match the sophisticated genetic and neuroimaging assessments widely available.

You are not 5% more intelligent. We do not have a measure of intelligence as a quantity. In Chapter 4, we discussed whether intelligence could be defined by quantifying brain characteristics like the amount of gray matter, thickness of the cortex, connectivity of networks, or the integrity of white matter. These are all potential ratio scales, but imaging is not a practical basis for wide use as an intelligence test in most settings. Another way to create a ratio measurement of intelligence depends on the measurement of time (8 seconds is literally twice 4 seconds). The concept is to create a standard battery of mental tests where the time it takes to arrive at an answer is the basis for the measurement rather than the number of correct answers. Intelligence could then be defined as speed of information processing during a standard set of test items. A person who had an average time of 4 seconds on a battery of information-processing test items would be literally twice as fast as a person with an average of 8 seconds.

To address this question, functional connectivity patterns among 268 brain nodes (making up 10 networks) were calculated for each person separately for each session. Not only was the comnectivity pattern stable within a person when the two resting conditions were compared, it was also stable across the four different tasks. In addition, each persons pattern was unique enough that it could be used to identify the person. Because these remarkable results combined stability and uniqueness, the connectivity pattern was characterized as a brain fingerprint.
