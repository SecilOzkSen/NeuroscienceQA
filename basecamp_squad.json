{"data": [{"title": "Product Histories", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Basecamp. Basecamp. On our website, we say Basecamp is a private, secure space online where people working together can organize and discuss everything they need to get a project done. See it, track it, discuss it, act on it. Tasks, discussions, deadlines, and files \u2014 everything\u2019s predictably organized in Basecamp. But we want it to be more than that. In mid-2016, we decided to focus on helping small business owners manage their businesses and help alleviate growth and organizational pains they\u2019re facing. Project management was our bread and butter for over 15 years. But we were inspired by how we, internally, have used Basecamp to run 37signals, and we want to extend that philosophy to our current customers and scores of brand-new customers."}, {"context": "But let\u2019s take a look back. In 2003, 37signals was a web design firm made up of 4 people. We always had work, but we were disorganized. With so many concurrent projects, things began to slip through the cracks. Projects dragged on too long. We dropped the ball on key deliverables. We had some major miscommunication. As many people even still do, we relied on email for everything. Things inevitably got lost, people get left out of conversations, there\u2019s nowhere to go to see what\u2019s left to do."}, {"context": "So we started looking for a project management tool. We tried a few tools, but they were complicated and didn\u2019t fit what we needed. Frustrated, we decided to build our own simple project management app. A few months later we had something ready, and we immediately started using this tool with our existing clients."}, {"context": "Lo and behold, our projects ran better! We regained the sense of order and calmness we\u2019d been craving. And clients noticed \u2014 they really appreciated the improved communication and organization. Soon after, our clients started asking us what software we were using to run these projects. Turns out they wanted to use it for their own in-house projects! So, we polished it up and put it on the market. On February 5th, 2004, Basecamp was born, and within a year, Basecamp was generating more income for us than our web design business, so we shuttered the web design firm to focus solely on Basecamp. That original Basecamp is called Basecamp Classic, and it still retains quite a few loyal customers! In 2012, we released our second version of Basecamp, referred to as BCX."}, {"context": "Fast forward to 2014. We\u2019d been feeling pulled in too many directions for too long. Campfire, Highrise, Backpack, and a host of other products were taking away from what we really wanted to do: maintain and improve Basecamp. So we spun off, sold, or otherwise sunset our ancillary products, and dedicated the entire company\u2019s efforts to Basecamp. In 2015 we launched our third version of Basecamp, BC3, and in 2022, we launched Basecamp 4."}, {"context": "HEY. HEY is our love letter to email. While our internal communications are almost exclusively in Basecamp (with code reviews in GitHub the primary exception), we still correspond with some external service providers and customers via email. Every time we needed to do that, we felt the drag: how much harder it was to manage and stay on top of email. So we eventually decided to do something about it. After over two years of work, we launched HEY in June 2020."}, {"context": "Highrise. In 2014, we decided to spin off or sell our other (very successful!) applications. One of those was Highrise, our customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Highrise became a subsidiary of 37signals run by its own board, executive, and staff. In 2018, we took back control of Highrise, disbanded the separate company, and turned off new signups. Highrise is now, as Basecamp Classic, Basecamp 2, Backpack, and Campfire, part of our until-the-end-of-the-internet legacy. Maintained for existing customers, but no longer developed for new features or new customers."}, {"context": "Ta-da List. Ten years ago, to-do list apps were few and far between. So, we created Ta-da List as a stand alone free subscription app at tadalist.com in January 2005. Now that people have to-do lists on their phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and refrigerator doors, we recognized that Ta-da List was a little outdated. We closed new signups to tadalist.com in 2012, but existing customers were able to retain their accounts."}, {"context": "Backpack. We created Backpack in May 2005 as a supplement to Basecamp Classic. Backpack existed as an organizer: \u201ca place to keep life\u2019s loose ends together\u201d. Users could make lists, notes, add files, upload pictures, and create Writeboards to share with other users. When we restructured in 2014, we closed Backpack to new customers, but existing customers still use (and love!) Backpack."}, {"context": "Writeboard. A tool called Writeboards lives in Basecamp Classic and Backpack. A Writeboard functions as a very simple, minimally formattable text document. In October 2005, we launched Writeboards.com, so people who wanted to use the tool without a Basecamp or Backpack subscription could do so. We retired Writeboards.com in 2014, but they still work in existing Basecamp Classic and Backpack accounts."}, {"context": "Campfire. In 2006, we built Campfire to help businesses communicate better. It\u2019s a simple, real-time web-based group chat tool that lets people set up password-protected chat rooms super quickly. At the very beginning, it didn\u2019t integrate with Basecamp, but when it did, it took off. Signups for Campfire were closed in February 2017."}, {"context": "37signals Suite. The 37signals Suite was a bundle of Basecamp Classic, Highrise, Backpack, and Campfire that allowed businesses to get big savings across the apps, simplify billing, and unify users across the apps. We retired the 37signals Suite offering after BCX was launched. Breeze. In 2012, we launched Echo, which turned into Breeze, a mailing list tool for small groups. We were excited about it, tried for a year to build up the product and bring in customers, but the product didn\u2019t take off like we hoped it would. Only about 1,200 customers signed up in that year, so rather than watch it limp along, we closed it down in August 2013."}, {"context": "Unlike our other retired products, we refunded our customers\u2019 money and closed the product entirely so not even existing customers could retain their subscription. We directed them to other small scale mailing list alternatives and apologized for the hiccup.

After Jason and David published their book REMOTE, we realized we wanted to be on the forefront of promoting remote work. So, we created and hosted WeWorkRemotely.com, which contains job postings for programmers, designers, marketing professionals, customer service representatives, writers, and more \u2014 all remote work positions. We posted thousands of jobs over the years we ran WWR. In spring 2017, we sold We Work Remotely to Metalab, to cut down on manual labor taken to run the board and focus more on our core business."}, {"context": "Sortfolio.com. In 2009, 37signals launched Sortfolio (previously named Haystack) to help clients find the right web designer in a more efficient way. Clients are able to filter by city and typical budget range and then peruse the results in a more visual way. We ended up selling Sortfolio in 2013 to be able to focus more on Basecamp and allow another company to give Sortfolio the love and attention it deserves."}, {"context": "Know Your Team (formerly Know Your Company). In 2013, 37signals created a software tool that allows managers to ask questions to gain insight into what their employees think about work, the culture, the direction of the company, what people are working on, or even something personal like their favorite recent movie. We created Know Your Team because when the 37signals team grew to about 30 people, Jason realized he didn\u2019t know the company or its people as well as he should have. So, Know Your Team was created initially as an internal tool that eventually became a product that we sold to customers. In 2014, we sold Know Your Team to Claire Lew, and she\u2019s been running it ever since!"}]}, {"title": "Titles for Ops", "paragraphs": [{"context": "We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of ops at Basecamp.

It should also be noted that these criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is capable of tackling independently.

Or being someone who says \u201cSure we can do that for you\u201d when a customer expected you to say \u201csorry, we can\u2019t.\u201d If the request is reasonable, grant it.

After speaking about shared values, here\u2019s one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, we\u2019ve always done things our way. We don\u2019t look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward.

Helping small businesses deal with growth. Growth happens.

Email doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. More meetings aren\u2019t going to solve the problem. And increasingly, incessant chatting creates exponentially more communication without the necessary structure and context to make it useful."}, {"context": "This is where Basecamp comes in. Basecamp helps growing companies organize their projects, internal communications, and client work in one place so they have a central source of truth.

We work in 6-week or 8-week cycles at 37signals. There are typically six cycles to a year. Two are 8-week cycles, during Summer Hours, and the rest 6-week cycles. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, work as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provide a regular interval to decide what we\u2019re working on."}, {"context": "The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take six or eight weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed."}, {"context": "This is particularly important for the product teams. Here we like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 6-weeker (or anything in between). This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 4-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what\u2019s reasonable and what\u2019s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain \u2014 and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on can fit within six normal weeks or eight summer weeks."}, {"context": "Cooldown. In between each cycle, we spend two weeks cooling down. That\u2019s the time to deal with bugs or smaller issues that come up, write up what we worked on, and figure out what we should tackle next. It\u2019s sometimes tempting to simply extend the cycles into the cooldown period to fit in more work. But the goal is to resist this temptation. Yes, sometimes a little spill-over will happen, but it\u2019s helpful to think about the end of the normal cycle as \u201cpencils down\u201d. That means that by week 4 of a normal cycle, we should be winding down, getting ready to launch, make sure QA is lined up, and all the other work that happens during and after the launch of new projects."}, {"context": "Communication. It\u2019s hard to keep up on what everyone is doing and what it means, if you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in 37signals. (It\u2019s also a waste of time and source of stress to even try.) Instead, we have four chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that\u2019s going on."}, {"context": "First, there\u2019s the daily question of What did you work on today?, which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They\u2019re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Please do use them as such! You\u2019re obliged to answer this question at least twice a week."}, {"context": "Second, there\u2019s the weekly question of What will you be working on this week?, which details your intentions for the coming week. Everyone except team OMG is obliged to answer this question when they\u2019re not out. Daily and weekly check-ins are subdivided by department so you're only subscribed to your team's answers. You're of course free to subscribe to other team check-ins, but you're not obligated to do so if you find it too noisy."}, {"context": "Third, there are the heartbeats. These are the team versions of What did you work on this cycle? This is where we summarize and celebrate the work that\u2019s been done. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account one week after a cycle has ended."}, {"context": "Fourth, and finally, there are the kickoffs. These are the team version of What are you going to work on next cycle? This is where the plan for the coming six or eight weeks is presented. Every team lead is obliged to write, or designate someone on the team to write, this account before the start of the new cycle. "}, {"context": "These mechanisms work together to free individuals and teams to run their days and cycles with confidence and independence. We have six opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it\u2019s easier for everyone to build trust in where we\u2019re going and why."}, {"context": "All these questions and write-ups will be posted in the What Works project for the current year. Pitches. Whether you work on the product development or not, your voice and observations can help determine what we should be working on. The way to exert this influence is through pitches. Write-up your idea of a new feature, a change to a feature, or any other product development you think we should be considering as a fully considered post (the more specific, the better). This gives the whole company a chance to consider and respond to the idea, and then we\u2019ll have the idea encapsulated in a post, available for reference at any time."}, {"context": "There\u2019ll always be more pitches than we have time to field, though. So it\u2019s important to have realistic expectations about what will happen after you posted your pitch. The default is simply that everyone involved with product development (and probably most everyone else in the company) will read and consider your pitch. That\u2019s a win right there. Even if the full pitch doesn\u2019t make it in, it can impact other product decisions by shining light on a weak point."}, {"context": "While a few pitches might instantly strike a chord loud enough to go on the plate for the next cycle, it\u2019s more likely that your pitch will sit for a while first. There are always more ideas than time, and we can only get a few things done each cycle. So chances are that even if everyone agrees the pitch is a great idea, it might not be the next most important thing for us to tackle. Don\u2019t be discouraged by this. We\u2019ve had many pitches that have sat for many cycles, if not years, before finally coming together and then happening."}, {"context": "Asynchronously. We have people working all sorts of different hours and from all sorts of different places at 37signals. That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that\u2019s a feature not a bug. Most of the work you do at 37signals shouldn\u2019t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone."}, {"context": "It\u2019s far better for everyone\u2019s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time."}, {"context": "Don\u2019t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that\u2019s fine. We have pings, hangouts, screensharing, or even in-person collaboration for when nothing else will do. (But most of the time something else will). All that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can just as well be cleared in 15-30-60 minutes, they become real annoying if it\u2019s a one-day turn-around every time."}, {"context": "In certain departments, like Support and Ops, it\u2019s even more important that people are dependently available when they say they will be. That work has a lot of interrupt-based jobs that simply needs to be done right here, right now. So what applies to almost all work for design and programming and QA may well apply a little less frequently there."}, {"context": "In self-sufficient, independent teams. Organizational theory is thick with descriptions of the trade-offs between functional and project company structures. We seek to be more project than functional. This means a single project team should be able to go from idea to deploy as independently as possible. Thus, the fewer other departments a team has to pass through on their road to rolling out a new feature, the better. We should be working on opening all these natural road blocks that form by default when you have awesome, strong departments, such as SIP, mobile, Ops, QA, and so forth."}, {"context": "For example, a team working on a new scheduling feature should be able to test and integrate their work with the native apps without involving mobile, unless something special is needed. Mobile shouldn\u2019t need a special heads up, and thus interruption and mental overhead or even guilt from lack of participation."}, {"context": "Similarly, a native feature that requires an API change should be carried out by that native team directly. When we need to use the staging database, that should be self-service too. Have a script anyone can run to restore it. Don\u2019t require going to ops and waiting around for someone to do it for us."}, {"context": "None of this means we can\u2019t talk together or ask colleagues with more experience or expertise for their advice. It just means it shouldn\u2019t be a required, necessary step to make 37signals better. As soon as organizational bottlenecks form, like a slew of features waiting for \u201cthe mobile integration\u201d, we\u2019re dragged towards more micro and detailed schedule management. It becomes a critical path with dependencies and making sure team Z is available just at the right moment for team A, such that nobody is blocked.

So if during that time it starts looking like your long-term employment won\u2019t work out, your manager will let you know early and why."}, {"context": "We hope, and fully expect, that your first 90 days will confirm what we learned in the hiring phase \u2014 you\u2019re well suited for this job, this team, and you\u2019re invigorated by the work to be done. Just put in your best effort, make sure you reach out if things aren\u2019t feeling right, embrace the feedback you get from your manager, and openly share your feedback with them!"}, {"context": "Mastery & Titles. Advancing your career at 37signals doesn\u2019t mean giving up on your craft. No matter your role, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we\u2019re a relatively small company with few layers of managerial cake. Within each of our job functions, we\u2019ve mapped our trajectory of mastery to five different levels. That title structure is shared amongst all departments, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here\u2019s an example of the titles for programming:"}, {"context": ". Junior Programmer. Programmer. Senior Programmer. Lead Programmer. Principal Programmer. While this is how we recognize mastery, it\u2019s by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. 37signals needs people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade+."}, {"context": "But these titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at 37signals. Note that these titles are about a particular role at 37signals. Someone may well have been a \u201cSenior Designer\u201d somewhere else with a different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at 37signals as a \u201cDesigner\u201d. We recognize mastery and titles at 37signals for the work done at 37signals."}, {"context": "Day to day, though, these titles aren\u2019t really much of a factor. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at 37signals. You can see the specific titles and proficiencies expected for: Designers, Ops, Programmers, Support, Data."}, {"context": "Pay & Promotions. 37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live. The comparison data is provided by a company called Radford that polls compensation data from all the major companies in our industry and plenty of our smaller peers as well. Because we don\u2019t pay bonuses, we match our base compensation to the base + bonus of our peer group."}, {"context": "Some jobs at 37signals are not matched to Radford comparison data. Compensation for common technical roles like programming and design is reliably competitive in a market like San Francisco. For some non-technical roles, compensation is much lower, much less competitive. To compensate for that industry disparity, we instituted a $73,500 salary floor (floor adjusted for inflation since publishing)."}, {"context": "The Radford data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it\u2019s warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 10% have gone up, we\u2019ll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don\u2019t decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we\u2019ll hold them steady until they come up again."}, {"context": "In addition to raises based on Radford market data, we\u2019ve also in the past given raises in excess of those based on core price index inflation numbers, if the market didn\u2019t move upward. This is not a guaranteed practice. Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at 37signals."}, {"context": "When you get a promotion, that is you move from one level to another, you\u2019ll get a corresponding pay raise effective on your next pay cycle. Performance Reviews. You\u2019ll meet with your manager for formal performance reviews. When you're new to 37signals, you'll meet at the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year marks. Then you'll meet once a year, around your anniversary with the company. Your manager will share performance expectations for your role when you start, and they'll keep you apprised of any changes to expectations should they evolve."}, {"context": "Managers are expected to document performance review outcomes and any action items or deadlines that come out of the meetings. Performance Improvement Plans. If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). We only initiate PIPs if your manager\u2019s concern is correctable in the short term. We do not initiate PIPs for fundamental performance issues that relate to your core job skills. If you\u2019re a Programmer whose coding skills are not at the level they need to be, we\u2019d forego a PIP. However we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management. In those cases, we\u2019ll follow our performance plan process."}]}, {"title": "Our Rituals", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Meetups. The entire company gathers in person twice a year. We meet up in a different city every time. In 2022, we traveled to Miami and Amsterdam. Most of the planning is taken care of for you; you just need to book your flights. Lodging, meeting space, agenda, and social outings will be planned and communicated well in advance."}, {"context": "In general, our meetups are largely unstructured. Every morning, we gather for breakfast at 8am. There are some scheduled talks, like the welcome session on Monday morning, lightning talks, and peer appreciation session. Occasionally, we bring in outside speakers or trainers. Other than that, the meet-up is intentionally loose. Teams huddle in a breakout room, groups go out for coffee or to explore the city, or managers meet 1:1s with employees. Connection and fellowship is always the #1 goal of any meetup, which we accomplish in different ways throughout the week."}, {"context": "Meeups are 1 week long. Most people arrive Sunday, we meet Monday through Thursday, and then we travel home on Friday. Everyone should come to every meet-up, but skipping one here and there is okay if you have an engagement you can\u2019t cancel. It's important to note that meet-ups can be overwhelming when we're so used to working on our own and virtually. But meetups are also rewarding and energizing, and you'll probably find yourself looking forward to the next one within weeks of returning home."}, {"context": "Mini Meetups. Once a year, you can get together with a small group of your coworkers on a mini meet-up at a destination of your choosing. Mini meet-ups should have a work focus. They\u2019re not meant to be social trips, and you\u2019re not doing just your day-to-day work in the same room as your coworkers. You should be collaborating on something meaningful. It certainly doesn\u2019t have to be big and you don\u2019t have to produce something by the end of the meet-up. Pick something you\u2019d love to have a week to discuss in person and have fun with it."}, {"context": "Keep in mind: your mini-meet-up team does not have to be your formal team like Ops, Support, Mobile, etc. Colleagues who are working cross-team who have a project to get together on can meet-up too. Limit yourself to 1 mini-meet-up per year though, whether that\u2019s with your dedicated team or with an offshoot team."}, {"context": "Budget guidelines for mini meet-ups can be found in Basecamp. Everyone on Support (EOS). Once every month or two, everyone in the company is given the opportunity to do a Customer Support shift. We call it Everyone on Support (EOS). Talking directly to customers all day helps us realize what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with our products. For the first few times you do EOS, you\u2019ll have a Support buddy to help you write clear and correct answers to customer questions through Help Scout, our support response tool, and then you\u2019re on your own!"}]}, {"title": "37signals Is You", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Everyone working at 37signals represents 37signals. When a customer gets a response from Merissa on support, Merissa is 37signals. When a customer reads a tweet by Eron that our systems are down, Eron is 37signals. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What\u2019s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they\u2019ll remember."}, {"context": "That\u2019s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone\u2019s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the bullshit of outage language and bending our policies, not just lending your ears. It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you\u2019d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction."}, {"context": "The vast majority of our customers come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. This is an audience we\u2019ve been educating and entertaining for 20 years and counting, and your voice is part of us now, whether you like it or not! Tell us and our audience what you have to say!"}, {"context": "This goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. 37signals not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate. We\u2019re prolific open source contributors through Ruby on Rails, Trix, Turbolinks, Stimulus, and many other projects. Extracting the common infrastructure that others could use as well is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that."}, {"context": "It\u2019s also worth mentioning that joining 37signals can be all-consuming. We\u2019ve seen it happen. You dig 37signals, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here\u2019s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We\u2019re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We\u2019ll all be better for it."}]}], "version": "private-domain"}
